The device number is prefixed by the subchannel set\n      identifier when appropriate.\n\n  chp\n      The channel path identifier (CHPID).\n\n  NOT OPERATIONAL\n      Because the channel path is not operational, the system could not\n      obtain data about the state of the channel path.\n\n  PERMANENT I/O\n      Because of a channel path error or a missing interrupt, the system\n      could not obtain data about the state of the channel path.\n\n  System action\n\n  The system varies the channel path offline and removes it from the dynamic\n  path group.\n\n  Operator response\n\n  Do the following:\n\n      1.  Isolate the failing control unit for repair.\n\n      2.  If there is only one remaining channel path, transfer critical\n          applications to backup.\n\n      3.  Contact hardware support.\n\n      4.  After the hardware problem is corrected, vary the channel path\n          online.\n\n  Source\n\n  Input/output supervisor (IOS)\n\n  Module\n\n  IOSRSNDV\n\n  Routing code\n\n  2,10\n\n  Descriptor code\n\n  11","additional":[]}
