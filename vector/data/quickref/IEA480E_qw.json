The\n   specified device or storage control has detected an abnormal condition\n   that requires operator or service attention.\n\n   In the message text:\n\n   yyyy\n       Address or number of the device or storage control that reported the\n       error.\n\n   SCU\n       Storage control hardware.\n\n   CACHE\n       Storage control cache of nonvolatile storage.\n\n   DASD\n       Storage device hardware.\n\n   MEDIA\n       Device data storage media.\n\n   SERVICE|MODERATE|SERIOUS|ACUTE\n       Describes the severity of the SIM event being reported. ACUTE is the\n       most severe and SERVICE is the least severe.

For MEDIA\n       ALERTs, the last digit of these twelve hexadecimal characters is the\n       recommended media maintenance procedure number.\n\n   volser\n       The volume serial number of the failing volume. This field is only\n       applicable for 3390 SIMs where the device or volume is involved in the\n       failure.\n\n   id\n       Two-hexadecimal character SIM ID. SIM ID is a subsystem-assigned\n       identifier for each individual SIM. It appears in the console message\n       as a discrete field only for 3390 SIMs. For 3990 SIMs, it is contained\n       in the REFCODE as the last two digits.\n\n   cccCCCC:H\n       MEDIA ALERTs only. Normalized hexadecimal cylinder/head address of the\n       failing track. Provided for use by automated media maintenance actions\n       or to initiate media maintenance actions without the need to run EREP.\n\n   REPEATED\n       Appears for non-MEDIA ALERTs only.

The\n   specified tape library, tape controller, virtual tape server, or tape\n   drive unit has detected an abnormal condition that requires operator or\n   service attention.\n\n   In the message text:\n\n   yyyy\n       Address of unit that reported the SIM message.\n\n   TLIB\n       Automated tape library.\n\n   TCU\n       Tape control unit.\n\n   TVIR\n       Virtual Tape Server (VTS).\n\n   TAPE\n       Tape drive.\n\n   mt\n       Machine type of unit that caused the SIM message. This will reflect\n       the software image of the machine type, not necessarily the underlying\n       physical machine type. VTS, for example, will report '3490' as the\n       machine type, even though the underlying drive machine type might be\n       3590.\n\n   ACUTE|SERIOUS|MODERATE|SERVICE\n       Indicates the severity of the SIM message. ACUTE is the most severe\n       and SERVICE is the least severe.\n\n   ser\n       Serial number of unit referenced by the SIM message.\n\n   mc\n       Message code.

Some software releases may not include\n       these codes.\n\n|      Note: If the serial number has a leading \"6\" in the first digit, then\n|      that serial number breaks the encoding rules and is improperly reported\n|      in the SER field. The correct serial number is reported in EBCDIC HEX\n|      format in the unit modifier fields (um1-um2-um3). For example:\n|\n|        IEA480E 1C00,TCU,3490, ACUTE ALERT,SER=6178-HDFH0,\n|        MC=F1,ES=11,ID=4D,REF=E000-3103-0000,UM=C8C4-F4C8-F0\n|\n|      The correct serial number is HD4H0 (0xC8='H', 0xC4='D', 0xF4='4',\n|      0xC8='H', 0xF0='0').\n\n   CLEAN\n       Tape drive requires cleaning cartridge to be inserted. Only returned\n       for a TAPE unit.\n\n   CLEAN/SERVICE\n       Tape drive requires cleaning cartridge to be inserted. Repeated\n       occurrences of CLEAN/SERVICE indicate the need for additional service.\n       Only returned for a TAPE unit.\n\n   CLEANED\n       Cleaning just completed for the tape drive. Cleaning cartridge\n       ejected. Only returned for a TAPE unit.\n\n   REPEATED\n       Indicates this SIM has already been presented at least once prior to\n       this presentation.\n\n   System action\n\n   The system logs an alert in the LOGREC data set and continues processing.\n\n   Operator response\n\n   The system issues this message to indicate that operator or service\n   attention is required. Follow your installation's procedures for obtaining\n   service. Consult your customer engineer, if applicable.\n\n   If the specified unit is TAPE and CLEAN is presented (or ES=89), then\n   cleaning is required. Note that some software levels will only specify the\n   ES code for cleaning.\n\n   If the specified unit is TAPE and CLEAN/SERVICE is presented (or ES=8B),\n   then cleaning is required. Note that some software levels will only\n   specify the ES code for cleaning.\n\n   Repetitive occurrences of the CLEAN/SERVICE message indicate that service\n   beyond cleaning is required.\n\n   If the specified unit is TAPE and CLEANED is presented (or ES=9A), then\n   cleaning was completed. No further action is required. Note that some\n   software levels will only specify the ES code for cleaning completed.\n\n   If the specified unit is TAPE and ES has any other value, then consult\n   your customer engineer for detailed recovery actions for the installed\n   tape drive.\n\n   If the specified unit is TLIB, then consult your customer engineer for\n   detailed recovery actions for the installed library.\n\n   If the specified unit is TVIR, then consult your customer engineer for\n   detailed recovery actions for the installed VTS product.\n\n   If the specified unit is TCU, then consult your customer engineer for\n   detailed recovery actions for the installed tape control unit.\n\n   System programmer response\n\n   Run an EREP System Exception Report to obtain a Service Information\n   Message report for additional information.\n\n   Source\n\n   DFSMSdfp\n\n   Module\n\n   IGGSNS02\n\n   Routing code\n\n   1, 6\n\n   Descriptor code\n\n   2, 4 for ACUTE ALERT\n   4 for other ALERT","additional":[]}
