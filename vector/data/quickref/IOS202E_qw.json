The system forces the channel path offline.\n\n      Note: If the user indicated to box devices via the HOTIO BOX_LP option\n      in the IECIOSxx parmlib member, then the device may become boxed\n      instead of undergoing channel path recovery processing.\n\n  CHP,F\n      The system forces the channel path offline. The system issues message\n      IOS202E.\n\n  Operator response\n\n  Do the following:\n\n      o See your installation's operating procedures. Try to\n        correct the problem at the lowest level of recovery. The\n        levels, from lowest to highest, are:\n\n          1.  Device - box the failing device.\n\n          2.  Control unit keep - perform recovery on the control unit\n              level and the devices attached to the control unit.\n\n          3.  Control unit - boxes the devices specified in the reply.\n\n          4.  Channel path keep - perform recovery on the channel path and\n              all control units and devices attached to the channel path.\n\n          5.  Channel path force - force the channel path offline.\n\n      o Reply with one of the following, as described in the message text:\n\n          NONE\n\n          DEV\n\n          CU\n\n          CU,K\n\n          CHP,K\n\n          CHP,F\n\n      o If channel path recovery did not clear the condition causing the\n        device to go hot, reply DEV, CU, or CHP,F the next time this message\n        occurs for the device.\n\n      If you reply DEV, physically disable the device.\n\n      o Contact hardware support.\n\n  When this message is issued before the MVS Console becomes active, IT IS\n  EXTREMELY IMPORTANT to respond promptly.
