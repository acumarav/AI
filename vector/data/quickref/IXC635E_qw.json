The XCF work to be performed by a\n        group member includes such things as processing of messages by a\n        message user exit routine, or processing of group events by a group\n        user exit routine.\n\n      o A member is confirmed impaired when the member's status exit\n        indicates that the member is not operating normally and is\n        considered to be in a status update missing condition.\n\n  See the explanation of message IXC633I for a description of situations\n  that can make a member appear impaired.\n\n  Note: It is very unlikely that the delays are caused by a problem in XCF.\n\n  It may not be possible to determine the impact to the sysplex, system, or\n  relevant application without understanding the type and nature of the work\n  items experiencing the delay. The impact may not be limited to the\n  impaired member if it provides services to other applications or\n  subsystems in the sysplex. Failure to process this work in a timely manner\n  can account for delays or performance problems elsewhere in the sysplex.\n\n  This message is not necessarily issued if the impaired member happens to\n  be an internal XCF member.\n\n  In the message text:\n\n  sysname\n      The name of the system on which the impaired members reside.\n\n  System action\n\n  XCF continues to monitor the situation. The message is deleted when no\n  member impairment conditions exist on the indicated system.\n\n  Messages IXC633I and IXC634I may be issued periodically to the log to\n  provide information about the current state of the impairment for a\n  particular group member. If an internal XCF problem is discovered, a dump\n  will be taken. An entry in logrec is made to document the situation even\n  if no dump is taken.\n\n  For critical members, if the active sysplex failure management (SFM)\n  policy MEMSTALLTIME specification for the local system specifies a value\n  other than NO, XCF will wait the MEMSTALLTIME to take action to address\n  the problem. If the active SFM policy MEMSTALLTIME specification for the\n  local system specifies or defaults to a value of NO, or SFM is not active,\n  XCF will wait two minutes or one failure detection interval (FDI),\n  whichever is longer, to take action to address the problem. XCF will\n  attempt to terminate critical members, or remove the system on which the\n  critical member resides, or both. If XCF terminates the member, it\n  requests a dump and issues message IXC615I.\n\n  Operator response\n\n  Monitor the situation. If there does not seem to be any detrimental\n  impact, no further action may be needed. On many occasions the system will\n  successfully resolve the situation during the course of normal processing.\n  Issue DISPLAY XCF commands on the indicated system to get more information\n  about the impaired group members:\n\n  o Use DISPLAY XCF,GROUP to determine which groups have impaired members on\n    the system. Message IXC331I lists the names of the groups and indicates\n    which ones have impaired members.\n\n  o Use DISPLAY XCF,GROUP,grpname to determine which members of group\n    grpname are impaired. Message IXC332I lists the names of the members and\n    indicates which ones are considered impaired by XCF.\n\n  o Use DISPLAY XCF,GROUP,grpname,membername to get detailed information\n    about the member membername of group grpname. Message IXC333I provides\n    status information about the member and indicates what work appears to\n    be impaired.\n\n  There may be other commands provided by the stalled application or\n  subsystem that will allow you to determine its status or alleviate the\n  problem. At the direction of the system programmer, you may need to obtain\n  dumps for problem diagnosis or terminate the indicated application. If\n  multiple members appear to be impaired, or if other indicators suggest\n  work is not being processed, check the status of the system because there\n  may be an underlying problem affecting them all.\n\n  The DISPLAY XCF,PATHOUT and DISPLAY XCF,PATHIN commands can be issued to\n  obtain detailed path status information to see if a member with a\n  signaling stall appears to be impacting message delivery.\n\n  System programmer response\n\n  Check the status of the stalled application or subsystem. On many\n  occasions the system will successfully resolve the situation during the\n  course of normal processing, in which case no further action is warranted.\n  Take appropriate action to correct the situation, cancel or terminate the\n  application. Before terminating the application, issue the DISPLAY\n  XCF,GROUP grpname,ALL command and any application specific display\n  commands that may be helpful in ascertaining status. Then collect the\n  following diagnostic information: system log, application log, and an\n  appropriate dump. In addition to application specific diagnostic data, the\n  dump should include XCF data (SDATA=COUPLE).

It could\n        be in an address space other than those identified by the IXC633I\n        message.\n\n      o An influx of work has exceeded the processing capacity of the member\n        or system. The influx may be a temporary spike that the system can\n        work through with time.

See the explanation of message IXC636I for a description of the\n  actions taken by XCF.\n\n  Operator response\n\n  This message is issued to the system log so no operator response is\n  expected. If through customer action, the message is rerouted to an\n  operator console, the operator should monitor the situation.

Message\n  IXC333I provides status information about the member and indicates what\n  work appears to be impaired.\n\n  There may be other commands provided by the indicated application or\n  subsystem that will allow you to determine its status and alleviate the\n  problem. If more than one member is impacted, there may be an underlying\n  system problem affecting them all. If so, investigate the status of the\n  system at large. At the direction of the system programmer, you may need\n  to obtain dumps for problem diagnosis or terminate the indicated\n  application.\n\n  XCF monitors its own internal use of the XCF signalling service and may\n  issue message IXC633I if XCF itself appears to be impaired. However, the\n  DISPLAY XCF,GROUP command cannot be used to investigate such impairment\n  conditions because the command does not support the internal XCF group.\n\n  System programmer response\n\n  Check the status of the indicated application or subsystem. If multiple\n  members appear to be impaired, or if other indicators suggest work is not\n  being processed, there may be an underlying problem affecting them all. If\n  so, a broader system diagnosis my be warranted because the impacted\n  members may not be at fault. On many occasions the system will\n  successfully resolve the situation during the course of normal processing,\n  in which case no further action is warranted. If necessary, take\n  appropriate action to correct the situation, cancel or terminate the\n  application. Before terminating the application, issue DISPLAY\n  XCF,GROUP,grpname,ALL and any relevant application display, then collect\n  the following diagnostic information: system log, application log, and an\n  appropriate dump.

A critical\n              member performs functions or provides services that are\n              critical to the overall operation of the member's group. By\n              extension, such functions or services can be critical to the\n              overall operation of the system. If these functions or\n              services are impaired long enough, the member may be\n              terminated. Such termination can cause the system to be\n              removed from the sysplex.\n\n          LOCAL CLEANUP NOT NEEDED\n              This line appears if LOCALCLEANUP=CONTINUE was specified on\n              the IXCJOIN invocation that caused the member to become\n              active. This indicates that the member will not need time to\n              perform additional cleanup when the system on which it resides\n              is being removed from the sysplex.

Signal transfer is measured from the\n              time that XCF accepts the message for delivery to the time\n              that the signal(s) arrive on the target system. For messages\n              that require multiple signals, each signal contributes\n              individually to the average (they are not aggregated to\n              provide one single transfer time for the message as a whole).\n              The transfer time does not include the time spent on the\n              receiving system after the signal arrives but before the\n              message is presented to the signal exit routine of the target\n              member.\n\n              Up to 64 of the latest signals received are considered when\n              computing the average transfer time. Signals received more\n              than a minute ago are excluded from the average. For an\n              infrequent receiver, excluding old signals can make it appear\n              that its transfer time is changing even though it is not\n              receiving any new signals. N/A is displayed if no data is\n              available (no signals recently received or the sending system\n              does not provide the necessary data).

As applicable, system\n                  impact records (SIMP) are shown to document the duration\n                  of the impact windows.\n\n              ! MISO\n                  The member was message isolated, but not anymore. However,\n                  at least one system still appears to be residually\n                  impacted by the isolation window. A symptom impact record\n                  (SIMP) describes the impact. Impacted systems that have\n                  recognized the closing of the isolation window provide a\n                  SIMP record documenting the duration of the impact window.\n\n              *MISO\n                  The member is currently message isolated. There does not\n                  appear to be any impact as a result of the isolation.\n                  However, so long as the member remains message isolated,\n                  messages sent to the member can be delayed or rejected.\n\n              !*MISO\n                  The member is currently message isolated. One or more\n                  members have been impacted by the isolation. One or more\n                  messages targeted to the member have been delayed or\n                  rejected by XCF. A system impact record (SIMP) describes\n                  the impact.\n\n              isosysnm\n                  The name of the system that hosts the member that was\n                  message isolated.\n\n              misoStartTime\n                  The date and time when XCF most recently isolated the\n                  member (mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm:ss.dddddd\n\n              windowSeq#\n                  A sequence number that can be used to identify the\n                  isolation window for the member. XCF increments this\n                  member isolation sequence number each time a new isolation\n                  window is opened for the member.\n\n              misoDuration\n                  If the isolation window has closed, the amount of time the\n                  member was message isolated (hh:mm:ss.dddddd). If the\n                  message isolation window exceeds 24 hours, the duration of\n                  the window is listed as \"-over 24 hours\".\n\n      SIMP\n          The system impact (SIMP) record documents the impact to a system\n          that was affected by message isolation of the subject member.\n          Requests by one or more members residing on the indicated system\n          had messages delayed or rejected by XCF when attempting to send to\n          the isolated member.\n\n          impsysnm\n              The name of the system whose members were impacted by\n              isolation of the target member.\n\n          impactStarted\n              The date and time when XCF most recently started an impact\n              window on system impsysnm (mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm:ss.dddddd) due to\n              the message isolation of the subject member. After a system\n              recognizes that a target member is message isolated, an impact\n              window is opened when the first message sent to the isolated\n              member is delayed or rejected by XCF. In general, impact\n              windows and isolation windows will coincide fairly closely in\n              time. But this need not always be the case. An impact window\n              might never open or it might open long after the isolation\n              window opens. For example, it might be the case that no member\n              tries to send a message to the target member during its\n              isolation window, or that the first attempt to send a message\n              to the target member occurs long after the isolation window\n              opens. Alternatively, the fact that a target member is message\n              isolated might not be recognized in a timely manner. Thus, the\n              sending system might continue to send messages to the isolated\n              target member long after the isolation window closes if the\n              sending system fails to recognize the closure of the isolation\n              window in a timely manner. Indeed, a given impact window might\n              span multiple isolation windows.\n\n          dr\n              A two character mnemonic intended to succinctly describe the\n              impact. The first character will either be a \"D\" or a \"-\" to\n              respectively indicate whether or not the impact includes\n              delayed messages. The second character will either be an \"R\"\n              or a \"-\" to respectively indicate whether or not the impact\n              includes rejected messages.\n\n          #delayed\n              The number of messages that were delayed due to message\n              isolation. For values in excess of 9999, the counts are\n              expressed in units of 1K, 1M, or 1G (roughly thousands,\n              millions or billions). A value reported as 34K implies that\n              somewhere between 34816 (=34k) and 35839(=35K-1) messages were\n              delayed.\n\n          #rejected\n              The number of messages that were rejected due to message\n              isolation. For values in excess of 9999, the counts are\n              expressed in units of 1K, 1M, or 1G (roughly thousands,\n              millions or billions).\n\n          impactDuration\n              If the impact window has closed, the amount of time the window\n              was open (hh:mm:ss.dddddd). If the impact window exceeds 24\n              hours, the duration of the window is listed as \"-over 24\n              hours\". Typically, an impact window is closed when system\n              impsysnm recognizes that the subject target member is no\n              longer message isolated. The impact window is also closed if\n              the target member becomes not active, or if all of the\n              impacted sending members on system impsysnm become not active.\n\n      CRITICAL\n          The data that follows describes the managed critical messages\n          being processed by the member.

An exit is considered stalled if\n              it has not made progress in a reasonable amount of time.\n\n          stxtkn\n              Hexadecimal token used by XCF to identify an exit routine.\n\n          stxtime\n              The date and time when XCF most recently started some phase\n              of exit processing (mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm:ss:dddddd). Usually\n              this time will be when XCF last called the exit routine.\n\n              o If the exit is PENDING, this time indicates when XCF\n                scheduled an SRB to give control to the exit routine.\n\n              o If the exit is PREPARING, this time indicates when XCF\n                started doing setup work before calling the exit routine.\n\n              o If the exit is RUNNING, this time indicates when XCF called\n                the exit routine.\n\n              o If XCF has not initiated processing for the exit routine, a\n                dash will appear.\n\n          stxfc\n              A mnemonic code indicating the function that the exit\n              routine is to perform.\n\n              SR\n                  The exit routine is to check for status update resumed.\n\n              SM\n                  The exit routine is to check for status update missing.\n\n              -\n                  XCF has not initiated processing for the exit routine.\n\n          stxtime\n\n              o If the exit routine has completed, the amount of time the\n                exit routine spent processing the work item (hh:mm:ss:dddddd)\n                is shown.\n\n              o If the time spent exceeds 24 hours, the time spent is listed\n                as \"--over 24 hrs--\".\n\n              o If the exit routine has not finished processing, one of the\n                following will be listed:\n\n                  PENDING\n                      The work unit for the exit routine has not received\n                      control. For example, an SRB routine was scheduled to\n                      call the user status exit routine but has not yet been\n                      dispatched.\n\n                  PREPARING\n                      The work unit is running but XCF is doing setup work\n                      needed for processing the work item.\n\n                  RUNNING\n                      The exit routine is currently processing the work item.\n\n                  FAILED\n                      The exit routine has failed.\n\n                  DEACTIVATED\n                      The status monitoring was removed because the exit\n                      routine failed repeatedly or because the status field\n                      is inaccessible.\n\n              o If the processing state is not known, a dash will appear.\n\n  System action\n\n  The system continues processing.\n\n  Source\n\n  Cross System Coupling Facility (SCXCF)\n\n  Module\n\n  IXCO1DCP\n\n  Routing code\n\n  #\n\n  Descriptor code\n\n  5,8,9\n ","additional":[]},{"heading":"IXC636I GROUP grpname MEMBER membername JOB jobname ASID asid IMPAIRED,\n         IMPACTING .CRITICAL.
