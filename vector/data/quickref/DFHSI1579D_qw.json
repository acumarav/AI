If the\nmessage is produced during the post-initialization PLT phase, the program did\nnot have a program entry which was installed and enabled, or the program was\nnot found in the CICS program library.\n\nFor connection programs, the program did not have an installed program entry\nor was not found in the CICS program library.\n\nmodname indicates which of the modules issued the message. progname is the\nname of the program which cannot be found.\n\nSystem action\nIf the response is 'CANCEL', CICS is terminated.
