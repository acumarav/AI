{"heading":"IEE767A SEVERE BUFFER SHORTAGE FOR SYSTEM LOG - 100% FULL","followUp":null,"content":"  Explanation\n\n  The system found that the system log task (SYSLOG) may be active and that\n  100% of its buffers are full.\n\n  System action\n\n  Write-to-log (WTL) processing ceases to allocate WTL queue elements.\n  Subsequent WTL requests result in a return code of 4 to the user.\n\n  Operator response\n\n  Increase the number of WTL buffers available to the system by entering the\n  CONTROL M,LOGLIM=xxxxxx command.\n\n  System programmer response\n\n  Before the next system initialization, increase the value of LOGLIM in the\n  CONSOLxx member of parmlib. This will allow for a higher number of\n  outstanding WTL buffers.\n\n  If your system is a JES3 system, you will need a higher default for the\n  LOGLIM parameter. See the z/OS MVS Initialization and Tuning Reference for\n  more information.\n\n  Source\n\n  Master Scheduler\n\n  Module\n\n  IEEMB804\n\n  Routing code\n\n  2,10\n\n  Descriptor code\n\n  2","additional":[]}
