REPLY 'I' TO IGNORE.","followUp":null,"content":"      Explanation\n\n      The named file system type has ended processing.\n\n      In the message text:\n\n      type\n          The file system type from the FILESYSTYPE statement in the\n          BPXPRMxx parmlib member.\n\n      System action\n\n      The system continues processing without the named file system type.\n      Processing for other file systems continues, but the system does not\n      try to restart the named file system type until the operator\n      responds to this message.\n\n      Operator response\n\n      Gather any error indications, such as diagnostic messages or dump\n      messages, that precede this message. If possible, correct the\n      problem and reply R to restart the file system type. If you cannot\n      resolve the problem, contact the system programmer. If processing\n      can continue without this file system type, reply I to remove the\n      prompt and leave this file system terminated.\n\n      In a shared file system environment, replying I results in moving\n      ownership of all file systems of the terminating file system type\n      and moving ownership of all subtrees mounted on those file systems.\n      Then all such file systems and their subtrees are unmounted. The\n      subtree unmount is local, except when the ownership of a subtree\n      cannot be moved to another system and then the local subtree unmount\n      is changed to a global subtree unmount across the sysplex.\n\n      System programmer response\n\n      If operator action did not restart the file system type, use the\n      error indication information to diagnose the problem, then reply R\n      to restart the file system type. If you cannot, search the problem\n      reporting data base for a fix. If no fix exists, contact IBM support\n      for the product that failed. If the reply to this message was I, and\n      you later want to restart that file system type, use SETOMVS\n      RESET=xx.\n\n      Module\n\n      BPXFSLM\n\n      Source\n\n      z/OS UNIX System Services kernel (BPX)\n\n      Routing Code\n\n      2\n\n      Descriptor Code\n\n      2","additional":[]}
