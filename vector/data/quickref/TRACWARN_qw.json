An action is suggested to correct the\n   condition.\n\n *TRACWARN - Database Area AT xx% FULL.\n\n  Reason: The database area is xx percent full. The percentage of space used\n  in each database area is calculated on a periodic basis (approximately 25\n  seconds). The message is deleted and reissued each time the percentage\n  changes.\n\n  Action: Enlarge the database area or clear records from the file by running\n  the 0JOBARCH task. When the situation is remedied, the message is deleted.\n  By default, this message is issued when the database area is 80 percent\n  full. You can change this percentage by using the following modify command:\n\n  F taskname,WARNPCT=nn\n\n  taskname is the name of the started task assigned at startup. nn is the\n  percentage you want to specify. nn must be numerical, in the range of 0 to\n  100, and does not require leading zeros.\n\n *TRACWARN - JOB eventname CATALOG ERROR NOTED\n\n  Reason: Unicenter CA JOBTRAC detected a catalog error. The sysout contains\n  an IEF2871 or an IEF2831 error message. The event is placed in a \"J\"\n  dependency status. The end user will need to take action on this job. This\n  event's successors will not be released until an action is taken.\n\n  Action: Follow normal rerun/restart procedures.\n\n *TRACWARN - JOB eventname FLUSHED, DID NOT EXECUTE.\n\n  Reason: The event specified in the message text received a JCL error at\n  conversion time or executed on a system without Unicenter CA JOBTRAC\n  internals initialized. The event is placed in a \"J\" dependency status. The\n  end user will need to take action on this job. This event's successors will\n  not be released until an action is taken.\n\n  Action: Follow normal rerun/restart procedures.\n\n *TRACWARN - JOB eventname STEP#nn stepname COND CODE = code VERS=mmdd.nnnn\n\n  Reason: The scheduled event eventname has encountered a step condition code\n  of code in step number nn and step name stepname. The condition code is not\n  within the specified job or job step boundaries.\n\n  The event is placed in a \"J\" dependency status and will continue to execute\n  if the JCL condition code tests allow. The end user will need to take action\n  on this job. This event's successors will not be released until an action is\n  taken.\n\n  Action: Follow normal rerun/restart procedures.\n\n *TRACWARN - JOB eventname .STEP=stepname. ABENDED, CODE = code VERS=mmdd.nnnn\n\n  Reason: The scheduled event eventname abended with a user or system abend\n  completion code. The event is placed in a \"J\" dependency status. The end\n  user will need to take action on this job. This event's successors will not\n  be released until an action is taken.\n\n  Action: Follow normal rerun/restart procedures.\n\n*TRACWARN GJTRUJV2 UNABLE TO LOCATE JCT\n\n  Reason: The Unicenter CA JOBTRAC SMF exit GJTRUJV2 cannot locate control\n  block JCT.\n\n  Action: If JES was upgraded or maintenance was applied to it, then usermod\n  UM00001 needs to be reapplied, and thereafter a recycle of Unicenter\n  CA JOBTRAC is needed. Should the problem persist, contact Technical Support\n  at http://ca.com/support for assistance.\n\n*TRACWARN SSCTSSID WAS NOT SET. ASSUMING THAT THIS IS JES3 BASED ON PRIMARY\n SUBSYSTEM NAME.\n    or\n SSCTSSID WAS NOT SET. ASSUMING THAT THIS IS JES2 BASED ON PRIMARY\n SUBSYSTEM NAME.\n\n  Reason: Unicenter CA JOBTRAC was unable to identify the JES type from the\n  JES subsystem entry field. The subsystem name field was used for\n  identification and the Unicenter CA JOBTRAC internals were adjusted\n  accordingly. This message may occur after an IPL with drained initiators or\n  when a Unicenter CA JOBTRAC primary system is replaced with a Unicenter\n  CA JOBTRAC monitor system.\n\n  Action: Verify that the JESx in the message matches your JES type. If the\n  JES type matches; no activity is required. If the JES type does not match,\n  reload the Unicenter CA JOBTRAC internals after the JES subsystem has been\n  initialized.\n\n*TRACWARN WARNPCT MUST BE 1-3 NUMBERS IN THE RANGE OF 0-100 - NO CHANGE MADE\n\n  Reason: An operator command was issued to change the WARNPCT with invalid\n  data.\n\n  Action: Reissue the command with 1-3 numbers between 0 and 100.\n\n*TRACWARN UPDATE ERROR: RC= cc JOB= xxxxxxxx\n\n  Reason: A database update did not complete successfully where cc is the\n  return code and xxxxxxxx is the job name.\n\n  Action:\n\n  o Gather documentation.\n\n  o Reschedule the job.\n\n*TRACWARN xx...xx AT nnn% FULL\n\n  Reason: The data set listed (xx...xx) is at nnn percent full.\n\n  Action: Consider expanding the data set.","additional":[]}
