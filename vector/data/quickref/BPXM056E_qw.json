{"heading":"BPXM056E UNIX SYSTEM SERVICES LATCH CONTENTION DETECTED","followUp":null,"content":"      Explanation\n\n      The system detected a z/OS UNIX System Services latch contention\n      situation that has existed for an excessive amount of time. As a\n      result this task is not progressing as expected nor are the tasks\n      waiting on the held resources.\n\n      System action\n\n      Processing continues, and latch contention continues until the\n      operator or system programmer take action to relieve the latch\n      contention situation.\n\n      Operator response\n\n      Notify the system programmer.\n\n      System programmer response\n\n      Issue the D GRS console command to gather information regarding the\n      latch resource, latch owner(s) and latch waiter(s). If the contention\n      persists and the owning unit(s) of work cannot be terminated through\n      normal operations (for example, Cancel or Force commands), consider\n      issuing a F BPXOINIT,RECOVER=LATCHES console command to resolve the\n      contention. This command can take several minutes to resolve the latch\n      contention, but if MVS cannot resolve the latch contention within a\n      reasonable time interval, MVS eventually displays action message\n      BPXM057E. If necessary, refer to that message for further action.\n\n      Note: If successful, the F BPXOINIT,RECOVER=LATCHES command causes the\n      abnormal termination of user tasks holding latches, generates one or\n      more address space dumps, and can result in the termination of an\n      entire process. Refer to z/OS MVS System Commands before issuing this\n      command.\n\n      Module\n\n      BPXMFILE\n\n      Source\n\n      z/OS UNIX System Services kernel (BPX)\n\n      Routing Code\n\n      11\n\n      Descriptor Code\n\n      11\n ","additional":[{"heading":"BPXM057E UNIX SYSTEM SERVICES LATCH CONTENTION NOT RESOLVING","copyright":"Text Below Copyright (c) 2023, IBM","followUp":"V=IBM P=Z/OS SYSTEM MSGS R=V2R5 I=BPXM057E","content":"      Explanation\n\n      The F BPXOINIT,RECOVER=LATCHES command did not resolve z/OS UNIX\n      System Services latch contention.\n\n      System action\n\n      Processing continues but requires the attention of the system\n      programmer to eliminate the contention situation.\n\n      Operator response\n\n      Notify the system programmer.\n\n      System programmer response\n\n      Reissue the F BPXOINIT,RECOVER=LATCHES command to again attempt to\n      resolve the contention.
