Some\n  WTOs is discarded.\n\n  System action\n\n  The system processes only WTO messages that might be critical to relieving\n  the buffer shortage, such as responses to the D C,B and D R commands. All\n  other WTO messages are discarded. Discarded messages are not sent to the\n  console.\n\n  Commands issued while WTO storage is exhausted are executed, but command\n  response messages are not displayed or logged except for responses to D\n  C,B and D R commands.\n\n  JES3 monitors some command responses to update status for devices and\n  jobs. Because these command responses are not issued JES3 is unable to\n  process the status changes. When buffer space becomes available, the\n  system issues message IEA655I.\n\n  Operator response\n\n  Examine the output from the D C,B command. Based on the information\n  displayed:\n\n  o If a console has accumulated a large number of messages, do one of the\n    following:\n      - Use the CONTROL Q command to purge the messages\n      - Use the CONTROL E command to delete messages\n      - Use the CONTROL S command to put the console into roll mode and\n        allow messages to roll off the screen\n      - Use the VARY CN command to deactivate the console.\n\n  o If an address space has accumulated a large number of messages notify\n    the system programmer.\n\n  o If a large number of messages have arrived from another system then\n    diagnose the problem on the system sending the messages.\n\n  o If a large number of messages are waiting for delivery to another\n    system, then try to relieve the buffer shortage on the target system.\n\n  System programmer response\n\n  If an address space has accumulated a large number of messages, follow the\n  response for message IEA099A. Otherwise, follow the system programmer\n  response for message IEA404A.\n\n  Source\n\n  Communications Task (COMMTASK)\n\n  Module\n\n  IEAVMQWR\n\n  Routing code\n\n  1,2\n\n  Descriptor code\n\n  1\n ","additional":[{"heading":"IEA655I WTOS NO LONGER BEING DISCARDED - nnnnnnnn MESSAGES WERE\n         LOST WHILE WTO STORAGE WAS EXHAUSTED","copyright":"Text Below Copyright (c) 2023, IBM","followUp":"V=IBM P=Z/OS SYSTEM MSGS R=V2R5 I=IEA655I","content":"  Explanation\n\n  The WTO storage shortage is less severe, and messages are no longer being\n  discarded.
