On the specified systems, sys1, sys2, ..., there\n  are temporal affinities between the client and the server region where the\n  server instance is running. The completion of the vary command is delayed\n  until all temporal affinities on all specified systems are released.\n\n  Note: TEMPORAL AFFINITIES EXIST ON sys1, sys2 ...\n        only appears when affinities exist.\n\n  In the message text:\n\n  VARY|INTERNAL\n      VARY indicates the V WLM,APPLENV command and INTERNAL indicates\n      an internal WLM action.\n\n  action\n      One of the following actions:\n\n      REFRESH\n          Specifies that the system is performing a REFRESH against the\n          application environment because of either VARY command\n          processing, or internal processing. WLM issues an internal\n          refresh when a procedure name or start parameters are changed.\n\n      QUIESCE\n          Specifies that the system is performing a QUIESCE against the\n          application environment.\n\n      RESUME\n          Specifies that the system is performing a RESUME against the\n          application environment.\n\n      STOP\n          Specifies that the system is stopping the creation of new server\n          address spaces because of repeated JCL errors in the start\n          procedure, or failures in the server address spaces.\n\n  applenv-name\n      The name of the application environment specified on the command.\n\n  sys1, sys2, ...\n      The systems where temporal affinities exist for the application\n      environment.\n\n  System action\n\n  The system is currently performing a vary command or WLM internal action\n  against an application environment.\n\n  Operator response\n\n  None.\n\n  System programmer response\n\n  If STOP appears as the action, then you should check the job log\n  for your server address spaces. If you cannot locate a JCL error,\n   then check whether the server address space is encountering\n  other processing errors.\n\n  Source\n\n  Workload manager (WLM)\n\n  Module\n\n  IWME2CCO\n\n  Routing code\n\n  2\n\n  Descriptor code\n\n  2,7","additional":[]}
