{"heading":"IEE088D IEE088D SLIP { COMMAND | ID=xxxx } SPECIFIES MODE=HOME WITHOUT\n         JOBNAME OR ASID. SPECIFY 'OK' (PERFORMANCE IMPACT) OR 'CANCEL'","followUp":null,"content":"  Explanation\n\n  A SLIP command was issued with MODE=HOME specified, but neither JOBNAME\n  norASID was included. The omission of these parameters may cause significant\n  performance impact. SLIP processing must monitor all changes of address\n  space to determine when MODE=HOME is or is not in effect, which will\n  increase system overhead (uncaptured time) as soon as the command is\n  activated.\n\n  Refer to the \"Setting Effective SLIP PER Traps\" section in the SLIP Command\n  in the z/OS System Command book. The SLIP trap may be set with the OK\n  operand specified to avoid receiving this message. Specification of the OK\n  operand on the SLIP indicates an awareness that the SLIP has the potential\n  for causing a significant performance impact on the system.\n\n  In the message text:\n\n  xxxx\n      The ID of the trap being set.\n\n  System action\n\n  SLIP command processor waits for a response. If the response is 'OK', the\n  trap will be set. If the response is 'CANCEL', the command will be\n  cancelled.\n\n  Operator response\n\n  One of the following:\n\n  o  If you have determined that the possible performance impact is acceptable\n     to obtain the necessary diagnostic data, set the trap by replying 'OK'.\n\n  o  If you want to avoid setting the trap, reply 'CANCEL'. You may then\n     reissue a corrected command including either the JOBNAME or ASID\n     parameter, or removing MODE=HOME.\n\n  Source:\n\n  SLIP\n\n  Module:\n\n  IEECB909\n\n  Routing code:\n\n  *\n\n  Descriptor code:\n\n  5","additional":[]}
