Currently, only the\n  SYSZTIOT resource is implemented. The message can contain up to 5 lines,\n  either displaying a JOBNAME and number of tasks in the job past the\n  current limit, or a JOBNAME and the TCB of the single task in the job\n  beyond the limit. The order of the displayed JOBNAMEs is in the order that\n  they appear in the CAS task list, which is generally from the oldest to\n  the newest. If there are additional tasks that are beyond the limit but\n  not displayed, a line is added to display the number of remaining tasks.\n\n  In the message text:\n\n  RESOURCE\n      Represents a class of possible contention or resources. RESOURCE is\n      one of the following:\n\n      o SYSZTIOT\n\n      o SYSZVVDS\n\n      o SYSIGGV2\n\n      o ALLOCLCK\n\n  JOBNAME\n      Job name associated with the CAS task over the wait limit.\n\n  ASID\n      Application ID associated with the CAS task over the wait limit.\n\n  number of tasks\n      The number of tasks over the limit associated with this job name.\n\n  System action\n\n  The system continues processing.\n\n  Operator response\n\n  None.\n\n  System programmer response\n\n  Determine if the jobs holding resources requires action. Note that the\n  issuance of this message does not mean that an error or problem exists. If\n  you cancel any of the jobs listed, consider taking a dump of the catalog\n  address space (CAS) first. The above message also provides enough\n  information to effectively use the CATALOG MODIFY commands to gather\n  additional information or terminate the associated CAS task, for example,\n  MODIFY CATALOG,LISTJ(JOBNAME), and so on.\n\n  Programmer response\n\n  None.
