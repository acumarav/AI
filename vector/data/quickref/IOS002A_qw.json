The system requires an I/O\n  interrupt to retry I/O requests to the device.\n\n  The system issued this message for one or more of the\n  following reasons:\n\n      o There are no paths available to the device\n\n      o During device initialization, the system encountered a permanent I/O\n        error\n\n  In the message text:\n\n  devn\n      The device number. The subchannel set identifier is indicated where\n      appropriate.\n\n  System action\n\n  In most cases, subsequent I/O requests to the device wait until the device\n  becomes available.\n\n  Operator response\n\n  An I/O interrupt is required to cause I/O requests to the device to be\n  retried. Do one of the following to simulate an I/O interrupt and cause\n  queued requests to be retried:\n\n      o Enter a VARY DEVICE ONLINE command for devn\n\n      o Enter a VARY PATH ONLINE command for a path to device devn\n\n      o If a serial fiber is not connected, connect the serial fiber to\n        device devn.\n\n  Source\n\n  Input/output supervisor (IOS)\n\n  Module\n\n  IOSVIRBN, IOSRDPSV, IOSVSLFD\n\n  Routing code\n\n  1,3/4/7/8\n\n  Descriptor code\n\n  2","additional":[]}
