The check date is the date specified by the DATE keyword of the\n    HZSADDCK macro that added the check or the DATE parameter of the ADD or\n    ADDREPLACE statement of the HZSPRMxx parmlib member that added the\n    check.\n\n  o A SYNCVAL value was specified and an INTERVAL or EXCEPTIONINTERVAL value\n    did not obey the following rules:\n\n    - for SYNCVAL(hh:mm) and INTERVAL OR EXCEPTIONINTERVAL(hhh:mm) the\n      (exception-) interval duration in total minutes hhh*60 + mm has to be\n      a divisor or a multiple of 1440 minutes (24 hours).\n\n    - for SYNCVAL(*:mm) and INTERVAL OR EXCEPTIONINTERVAL(hhh:mm) the\n      (exception-) interval duration value in total minutes hhh*60 + mm has\n      to be a divisor or a multiple of 60 minutes (one hour).\n\n  Note that a conflict can occur when any of the following occur:\n\n  o The policy statement specifies a SYNCVAL that is in conflict with the\n    checks INTERVAL OR EXCEPTIONINTERVAL\n\n  o The policy statement specifies an INTERVAL OR EXCEPTIONINTERVAL that is\n    in conflict with the checks SYNCVAL\n\n  o The policy statement specifies a SYNCVAL that is in conflict with an\n    INTERVAL OR EXCEPTIONINTERVAL in the policy\n\n  In the message text:\n\n  checkowner\n      The owner of the check\n\n  checkname\n      The name of the check\n\n  polstmt\n      The policy statement name\n\n  System action\n\n  The system continues processing.\n\n  Operator response\n\n  For any conflict, issue the MODIFY\n  hzsproc,DISPLAY,CHECK=(*,*),POLICYEXCEPTIONS command to determine the\n  checks that were found for which a matching policy statement had a\n  conflict.\n\n  System programmer response\n\n  For a DATE conflict, examine the outdated policy statements and the checks\n  to which they apply. Ensure that the parameters and values on the policy\n  statement are still appropriate for the check(s) to which that policy\n  statement applies. Update the policy statement with a new date and any\n  other changed needed.\n\n  For a SYNCVAL conflict, change the SYNCVAL or INTERVAL or\n  EXCEPTIONINTERVAL value so that the INTERVAL or EXCEPTIONINTERVAL duration\n  is an appropriate divisor or multiple of 24 hours or one hour\n  respectively. To display the check values, issue the MODIFY\n  hzsproc,DISPLAY,CHECK=(check_owner,check_name),DETAIL command for the\n  check(s) identified by the MODIFY\n  hzsproc,DISPLAY,CHECK=(*,*),POLICYEXCEPTIONS command and find the values\n  that are in conflict.\n\n  Problem determination\n\n  None\n\n  Module\n\n  HZSPKANP,HZSINPRM,HZSMIMST\n\n  Routing code\n\n  1,2,10\n\n  Descriptor code\n\n  7,11\n\n  IBM Health Checker for z/OS","additional":[]}
