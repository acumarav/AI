Each file system mount will\n      be completed asynchronously and directories will be reconnected.\n      While refreshing, file requests for file systems in this PFS will\n      either suspend or fail. When all file system mounts are complete,\n      file requests can resume.\n\n      Operator response\n\n      If the condition persists, contact the system programmer. D OMVS,PFS\n      will show the recycle status of the PFS. D OMVS,F will show the\n      mount status of individual file systems.\n\n      System programmer response\n\n      D OMVS,PFS will show the start time of a recycle. Use MODIFYOMVS,\n      STOPPFS=pfsname to terminate the PFS and stop the recycle.\n\n      Module\n\n      BPXVOCTL\n\n      Source\n\n      z/OS UNIX System Services kernel (BPX)","additional":[]}
