When the BMF or IMF LRU stalls, buffers are not reused and\n  the amount virtual storage used by the PDSE address space will grow.\n  Over time this can have an affect on system performance.\n\n  In the message text:\n\n  sssssss\n      identifies the address space with the problem: SMSPDSE or SMSPDSE1.\n\n  mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm:ss.tttttt\n      The date and time when the BMR or IMF LRU last successfully\n      completed its processing.\n\n  xxxxx\n      The buffer space used in MB.\n\n  System action\n\n  IGW048A is issued as a delete operator message to the console to\n  indicate the detection of a possible PDSE processing problem.\n\n  Operator response\n\n  None.\n\n  System programmer response\n\n  Issue V SMS,PDSE,ANALYSIS command to determine what may be wrong with the\n  PDSE(s). For detail about this command and what actions to take, see z/OS\n  DFSMSdfp Diagnosis. If the problem cannot be corrected and the amount of\n  storage used affects the system operation, you may want to schedule a\n  restart of the SMSPDSE1 address space.\n\n  Source\n\n  DFSMSdfp\n\n  Module\n\n  IGWLHAT1","additional":[]}
