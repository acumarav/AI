For details about these codes,\n      see z/OS MVS Programming: Authorized Assembler Services Reference\n      EDT-IXG.\n\n  hh.mm.ss\n      The time in hours (00-23), minutes (00-59), and seconds (00-59)\n\n  System action\n\n  The system disconnects from either the system logger or the\n  logstream, as indicated in the message. SMF data is being buffered.\n\n  Operator response\n\n  Contact the system programmer.\n\n  System programmer response\n\n  Refer to the return and reason codes for the IXGCONN logger connect\n  service in z/OS MVS Programming: Authorized Assembler Services\n  Reference EDT-IXG and resolve the system logger problem that led to\n  the resource being unavailable. In some cases, SMF may be able to\n  resume processing automatically once the problem is resolved.\n  However, SMF cannot always detect when the problem is resolved, so\n  it may be necessary to cause SMF to reconnect to the resource via a\n  SET SMF=xx or SETSMF RECORDING(LOGSTREAM) command. The DISPLAY SMF,S\n  command can be used to obtain status of SMF logstream recording.\n\n  Source\n\n  System management facilities (SMF)\n\n  Module\n\n  IFALSMOD\n\n  Routing code\n\n  2,10\n\n  Descriptor code\n\n  11","additional":[]}
