Message CNZ3014I is issued to hardcopy to\n  indicate that a console has become backlogged. Normal message processing\n  resumes when either the number of WTOs is reduced below the buffer limit\n  or the console is no longer backlogged.\n\n  Operator response\n\n  Enter the DISPLAY CONSOLES command. If the system has accumulated a large\n  number of WTO messages, do one or more of the following:\n\n  o Enter the CONTROL Q command to clear the console's message queue.\n\n  o Enter the CONTROL E,D command to delete a multiline message in an out of\n    line area. Note that messages already queued to a display area are not\n    deleted by a CONTROL Q.\n\n  o Enter CONTROL E,D to erase these messages if the CONTROL Q command does\n    not relieve the shortage.\n\n  o Enter the CONTROL M,MLIM command to increase the value of the WTO buffer\n    limit.\n\n  o Enter the CONTROL S,DEL=R command to put the display console in roll\n    mode to let a specified number of messages roll off the screen at a\n    specified time interval.\n\n  o Respond to any messages requesting an operator action.\n\n  o Use the D C,B command to determine which consoles are backlogged.\n    Varying offline consoles that have a large backlog of messages release\n    WTO buffers.\n\n  System programmer response\n\n  Before the next system initialization, increase the value of MLIM in the\n  CONSOLxx parmlib member to increase the maximum number of WTO buffers that\n  SMCS, MCS, or HMCS consoles can use.\n\n  Source\n\n  Communications task (COMMTASK)\n\n  Module\n\n  IEAVMQWR\n\n  Routing code\n\n  2,10\n\n  Descriptor code\n\n  2\n ","additional":[{"heading":"CNZ3014I CONSOLE console-name IS BACKLOGGED.
