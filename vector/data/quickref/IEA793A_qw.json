An available dump data set is either\n  a SYS1.DUMPnn data set with the first record containing an end of file, or\n  an automatically allocated data set. If automatic dump data set allocation\n  is already active, check the syslog for a previous IEA799I message for\n  details about the dump data set allocation failure.\n\n  In the message text:\n\n  dumpid\n     A 3-character dump identifier.\n\n  System action\n\n  SVC dump processing continues to search for an available dump data set\n  until one of the following occurs:\n\n  o An available dump data set is found\n\n  o The operator replies D to delete the captured dump\n\n  o The interval specified by the MSGTIME parameter on the CHNGDUMP command\n    expires\n\n  Operator response\n\n  Do one of the following:\n\n  o Use the DUMPID on the DISPLAY DUMP command to display the title or error\n    information.\n\n  o Enter the DUMPDS command to clear an existing dump data set or to add a\n    new dump data set in order to write the dump to a data set.\n\n  o Reply D to the message. SDUMP will delete the captured dump.\n\n  o Run a utility to clear an existing dump data set.\n\n  o Add additional SMS classes (DUMPDS ADD,SMS=) or DASD volumes (DMPDS\n    ADD,VOL=) to the automatic allocation facility, or correct the problem\n    which caused the automatic dump data set allocation failure.\n\n  If a utility other than DUMPDS is used to make a dump data set available\n  automatically, no response is required. SVC dump processing periodically\n  searches the queue of data sets until one becomes available or the MSGTIME\n  interval expires.\n\n  Source\n\n  SVC dump\n\n  Module\n\n  IEAVTSCD\n\n  Routing code\n\n  1\n\n  Descriptor code\n\n  2","additional":[]}
