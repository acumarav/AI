{"heading":"BPXM123E z/OS UNIX HAS DETECTED THAT A GRS LATCH HAS BEEN HELD\n          BY JOB jjjjjjjj FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME","followUp":null,"content":"      Explanation\n\n      z/OS UNIX processing has detected a potential latching problem. A UNIX\n      System Services GRS latch has been held (without contention) by the\n      specified job for an extended period of time.\n\n      In the message text:\n\n      jjjjjjjj\n          The name of the job that holds a UNIX System Services GRS latch.\n\n      System action\n\n      None.\n\n      Operator response\n\n      None.\n\n      System programmer response\n\n      If the JOB listed in the message text is UNKNOWN, then the job that\n      obtained the latch is no longer active. This may indicate an\n      application error. If contention develops for this latch, it will\n      eventually be cleaned up and no intervention is necessary\n\n      If the JOB listed is something other than UNKNOWN, issue the D\n      GRS,LATCH, JOB= command to gather information regarding which z/OS\n      UNIX latch the job owns. For a latch in the\n      SYS.BPX.A000.FSLIT.FILESYS.LSN or SYS.BPX.A000.FSLIT.FILESYS.LSN.xx\n      latch set, issue the D OMVS,WAITERS command for additional information\n      about the latch. Collect\n\n      LOGREC, SYSLOG, and a CONSOLE DUMP of the ASID associated with the JOB\n      holding the latch, the zFS address space, the OMVS address space, and\n      the OMVS dataspaces.\n\n      If it is determined that the latch is being held in error, use the\n      CANCEL command to attempt to free it.\n\n      Note:\n\n       1. Some jobs cannot be cancelled, for example OMVS and BPXOINIT.\n\n       2. Some jobs provided services to many users (servers). Consider the\n          impact of cancelling those types of job before using the CANCEL\n          command.\n\n      Module\n\n      BPXLKLCP,BPXLKLCP,BPXMIMSK\n\n      Source\n\n      z/OS UNIX System Services (BPX)\n\n      Routing Code\n\n      1, 10\n\n      Descriptor Code\n\n      11","additional":[]}
