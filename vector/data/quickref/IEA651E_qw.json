{"heading":"IEA651E SYSPLEX DUMP DIRECTORY PROCESSING TERMINATED","followUp":null,"content":"  Explanation\n\n  Because of a failure, the system could not automatically add a source\n  description for an SVC dump to the sysplex dump directory. This is the\n  tenth failure. The cause of the failures could be that:\n\n  o The sysplex dump directory was full.\n\n  o A sysplex dump directory had not been created.\n\n  o The sysplex dump directory was not specified.\n\n  o The sysplex dump directory was continually in use.\n\n  o The SYSDDIR statement in the BLSCUSER parmlib has not been processed.\n\n  System action\n\n  The system disables the function to add source descriptions for SVC dumps\n  to the sysplex dump directory. The system deletes the outstanding requests\n  to add source descriptions; no new requests is created.\n\n  Programmer response\n\n  Check the causes listed in the explanation and correct the problem. Then\n  cancel the DUMPSRV address space. When the DUMPSRV address space restarts,\n  the add function is again enabled.\n\n  Source\n\n  SVC dump\n\n  Module\n\n  DSE","additional":[]}
