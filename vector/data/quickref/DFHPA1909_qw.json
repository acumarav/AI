The message inserts are as\nfollows:\n\n  o keyword is the keyword for which the value is in\n    error.\n\n  o data is the invalid data. This value may be truncated\n    if it is too long to be displayed.\n\nNote:\nPARMERR=INTERACT is the default action for invalid\nkeyword data.\n\nSystem action\n\nCICS waits for the corrected keyword and data to be\nentered as an override on the console by the operator,\nand analyzes this override.\n\nUser response\n\nEnter the corrected SIT keyword and data on the\nconsole. To enter lowercase data, start the System\nCommand Extension function by typing a / by itself on\nthe SDSF command line, or by adding a trailing + to a /\ncommand, then enter the override enclosing both the\nkeyword and data in apostrophes, remembering that\nthe keyword itself must be in uppercase. The\ncommand is still echoed in uppercase in the job log,\nbut SDSF processes the value in mixed case.\n\nTo bypass type '.END', or supply a blank line.\n\nAlternatively enter 'CANCEL' to terminate CICS.\n\nModule:\n\nDFHPAGP\n\nDestination\n\nConsole","additional":[]}
