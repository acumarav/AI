{"heading":"IEA405E WTO BUFFER SHORTAGE - 80% FULL","followUp":null,"content":"  Explanation\n\n  The number of write to operator (WTO) messages is 80% of the limit value\n  specified in the MLIM parameter of a CONSOLxx parmlib member.\n\n  System action\n\n  Processing continues. Consoles that are currently in HOLD mode and have\n  messages waiting are taken out of HOLD mode. The system no longer holds\n  messages for other systems in the sysplex. If another system is\n  experiencing a WTO buffer shortage, this system resumes sending messages\n  to the constrained system. The system issues a D C,B command and a D\n  EMCS,ST=B,L=Z command.\n\n  Operator response\n\n  Enter the DISPLAY CONSOLES command. If the console has accumulated a large\n  number of WTO messages, do one or more of the following:\n\n  o Enter the CONTROL Q command to purge the messages.\n\n  o Enter the CONTROL S command to delete a specified number of messages.\n\n  o Enter the CONTROL M,MLIM command to increase the value of the WTO buffer\n    limit.\n\n  o Put the display console in roll mode to let a specified number of\n    messages roll off the screen at a specified time interval.\n\n  o Respond to any messages requesting an operator action.\n\n  System programmer response\n\n  Before the next system initialization, increase the value of MLIM in the\n  CONSOLxx parmlib member to increase the maximum number of buffers that WTO\n  messages can use.\n\n  Source\n\n  Communications task (COMMTASK)\n\n  Module\n\n  IEAVMQWR\n\n  Routing code\n\n  2,10\n\n  Descriptor code\n\n  11","additional":[]}
