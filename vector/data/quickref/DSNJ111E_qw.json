Db2 recovery logging cannot continue.\n\nSystem action\n\nThe Db2 log manager waits for an available data set.\n\nThis message is non-scrollable. It remains highlighted on the console until\nyou take the appropriate action.\n\nOperator response\n\nExecute an MVS(TM) Display System Requests command (D R,L for example) to\nensure that there are no outstanding requests that are related to the log\noffload process. Take the necessary action to satisfy any requests, and permit\noffload to continue.\n\nSystem programmer response\n\nExamine the JES job log for the system services address space (ssnmMSTR) to\ndetermine the cause of the delay. If the delay was caused by the lack of a\nresource required for offload, the necessary resource must be made available\nto allow offload to complete and thus permit logging to proceed.\n\nRelated concepts\n\no  Effects of interruptions and errors on the offload process\n\nRelated information\n\no  Recovering from temporary resource failure\n\no  Recovering from active log failures\n\no  Recovering from being out of space in active logs","additional":[]}
