This situation can result in a very long restart if\nlogging continues without a system checkpoint. You should monitor system\ncheckpoint activity very closely. You can use the -DISPLAY LOG command or run\nthe Print Log Map utility (DSNJU004) to display the most recent checkpoint. If\nDb2 continues logging beyond the defined checkpoint frequency, you should\nquiesce activity and terminate Db2 to minimize the restart time.\n\nPrior to terminating Db2, obtain a dump of the Db2 address spaces for problem\ndetermination.","additional":[]}
