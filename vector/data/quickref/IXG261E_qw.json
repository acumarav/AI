{"heading":"IXG261E SHORTAGE OF DIRECTORY EXTENT RECORDS TOTAL numTotal IN\n         USE: numInuse AVAILABLE: numAvail","followUp":null,"content":"  Explanation\n\n  System logger has detected a shortage of log data set directory extent\n  records in the active LOGR couple data set for PRODUCTION group log\n  streams. System logger might eventually fail log stream offloads if it\n  cannot obtain a log data set directory extent required to process the\n  offload. The system issues this message if the number of in-use log data\n  set directory extent records in the active LOGR couple data set exceeds 85\n  percent of the total number of log data set directory extent records in\n  the LOGR couple data set. The counts in the message are the values that\n  existed when the condition was detected. These do not reflect the real\n  time record counts in the current couple data set.\n\n  In the message text:\n\n  numTotal\n      is the total number of log data set directory extent records\n      formatted in the active primary LOGR couple data set.\n\n  numInuse\n      is the number of log data set directory extent records currently\n      in use in the active primary LOGR couple data set.\n\n  numAvail\n      is the number of log data set directory extent records available\n      for use in the active primary LOGR couple data set.\n\n  System action\n\n  The system logger will continue processing. This condition can\n  proceed in one of two directions:\n\n      1.  Shortage is relieved\n\n          This means that the number of in-use log data set directory extent\n          records has dropped below 80 percent of the total formatted in the\n          active primary LOGR couple data set for the PRODUCTION group.\n\n          This could happen either as a result of system activity resulting\n          in a number of log data set directory extent records being freed\n          from log streams, thus increasing the available pool for the\n          PRODUCTION group or because a new LOGR couple data set was brought\n          into the sysplex as the primary LOGR couple data set and this LOGR\n          couple data set was formatted with a larger number of log data set\n          directory extent records.\n\n          The shortage could also be relieved if the activities of TEST\n          group log streams are reduced by deleting TEST group log streams\n          or by reducing the retention period for log data associated with\n          TEST group log streams.\n\n          If this storage is relieved, this message will be deleted (DOMed).\n\n      2.  Shortage becomes critical\n\n          This means that the number of in-use log data set directory\n          extent records has exceeded 95 percent of the total formatted in\n          the active primary LOGR couple data set.\n\n          If this occurs, the system will issue message IXG262A to notify\n          you of the critical shortage.\n\n  Operator response\n\n  Notify the system programmer.\n\n  System programmer response\n\n  You must increase the pool of available log data set directory\n  extent records in the active primary LOGR couple data set. You\n  can increase the available pool in one of the following two\n  ways:\n\n      1.  Formatting a new LOGR couple data set.\n\n          You can format a new LOGR couple data set and increase the number\n          of log data set directory extent records through the DSEXTENT\n          keyword on the couple data set format utility. As help in\n          determining the number of additional log data set directory extent\n          records to specify, this message includes the total number of log\n          data set directory extent records that are formatted in active\n          primary LOGR couple data set, numTotal, the number of currently\n          in-use log data set directory extent records, numInuse, and the\n          number of currently available log data set directory extent\n          records, numAvail.\n\n          To relieve the shortage, you must reduce the number of in-use log\n          data set directory extent records to below 80 percent of the total\n          formatted.\n\n          Complete the following steps to create and bring in a LOGR couple\n          data set with more DSEXTENT records:\n\n              a.  Run formatting job IXCL1DSU to create two (2) new LOGR\n                  couple data sets with the updated DSEXTENT numbers.\n\n              b.  Use the SETXCF COUPLE,TYPE=LOGR,PSWITCH command to set\n                  the current LOGR couple data set alternate as the\n                  primary.\n\n              c.  Use the SETXCF COUPLE,TYPE=LOGR,ACOUPLE=(dsname1,volume1)\n                  command to define one of the newly formatted couple\n                  data sets as the new alternate.\n\n              d.  Use the SETXCF COUPLE,TYPE=LOGR,PSWITCH command to\n                  switch to the new alternate again so that the newly\n                  formatted LOGR couple data set is now primary.\n\n              e.  Use the SETXCF COUPLE,TYPE=LOGR,ACOUPLE=(dsname2,volume2)\n                  command to define other newly formatted couple data\n                  sets as alternate.\n\n      2.  Freeing log data set directory extents from existing log streams.\n\n          You can also relieve the shortage by freeing log data set\n          directory extent records being consumed by existing log stream\n          definitions. You can free log data set directory extent records\n          in two different ways:\n\n              a.  Deleting log stream definitions.\n\n                  If you can identify unnecessary log stream definitions that\n                  are consuming log data set directory extents, deleting the\n                  log stream definition will immediately free the log data\n                  set directory extents associated with that log stream back\n                  into the available pool.\n\n                  As an aid in detecting unnecessary log stream definitions,\n                  check the log stream GROUP attribute. You can delete TEST\n                  group log streams before you delete PRODUCTION group log\n                  streams.\n\n              b.  Reducing the retention period for log data.\n\n                  If you can identify log streams that are defined with\n                  excessive retention periods and these log streams are\n                  consuming log data set directory extent records, you can\n                  free up log data set directory extent records by reducing\n                  the retention period, thus increasing the available pool.\n\n                  For TEST group based log streams, you can make the\n                  retention period small so that the data can be quickly\n                  deleted, thus occupying less directory extent records.\n\n                  Note: System logger does not necessarily react immediately\n                  to reductions in the retention period. The rule for when\n                  system logger will process reductions in the retention\n                  period is upon the next log data set switch event for the\n                  log stream. This implies that the log stream must be\n                  connected and incurring sufficient write activity to force\n                  data set switch events.\n\n                  You can run a report of the log streams defined in the\n                  LOGR couple data set to help you identify candidates for\n                  cleanup.

When the companion message IXG002E presents\n   return code X'08', reason code X'805', then Diag1 and Diag2 in message\n   IXG003I contains the following:\n\n       o Diag1 in message IXG003I contains either an internal logger return\n         code or the contents of the 4-byte field S99ERSN. More information\n         on internal logger return codes and S99ERSN appears below.\n\n       o Diag2 in message IXG003I contains either the contents of the 4-byte\n         field S99ERSN, or the contents of the 2- byte field S99ERROR\n         followed by the 2-byte field S99INFO. More information on these two\n         fields appear below.\n\n   S99ERSN, S99ERROR and S99INFO are fields in the IEFZB4D0 control block\n   that the logger uses to communicate with dynamic allocation.\n\n   The following are internal logger return codes you can find in Diag1:\n   X'04', X'10', X'14', X'1C'. When Diag1 contains these internal logger\n   return codes, contact IBM.\n\n   S99ERROR is documented in Interpreting error reason codes from DYNALLOC in\n   z/OS MVS Programming: Authorized Assembler Services Guide.\n\n   S99ERSN is documented in S99RBX fields in the z/OS MVS Programming:\n   Authorized Assembler Services Guide.\n\n   S99INFO is documented in Interpreting error reason codes from DYNALLOC in\n   z/OS MVS Programming: Authorized Assembler Services Guide.\n\n   After you have researched the meaning of S99ERROR, S99ERSN and S99INFO,\n   you might be able to find more information about the meaning of S99ERSN by\n   looking up a DFSMS message whose ID is IGDxxxx. You can compute xxxx: It\n   is the value found in S99ERSN, converted to decimal. The documentation for\n   this IGDxxxx message gives the meaning of the value found in S99ERSN, even\n   if the DFSMS message does not appear in syslog. Not all values of S99ERSN\n   map to an IGDxxxx message. Here are some examples of S99ERSN values and\n   the related message ID: If S99ERSN is x'00042CF', the DFSMS message ID is\n   IGD17103. Sometimes zeros must\n\n   be inserted after IGD. For example, if S99ERSN is x'00003F6', the DFSMS\n   message ID is IGD01014. IGD messages are documented in z/OS MVS System\n   Messages, Vol 8 (IEF-IGD).\n\n   Look in syslog for any messages that were issued near the time your\n   IXCMIAPU job ran. Look for messages that begin with IXG. Messages of\n   interest will often have 2 message IDs; the first message ID is IXG251I\n   and the second begins with IGD, IDC, IKJ, IEF or ICH.\n\n   If message IXG263E was issued, follow the action documented for that\n   message.\n\n   If the problem persists, search problem reporting data bases for a fix for\n   the problem.
