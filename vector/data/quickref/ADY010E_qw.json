{"heading":"ADY010E THE DAE START TRANSACTION FAILED text","followUp":null,"content":"      Explanation\n\n      The ADYSETxx parmlib member specified in a SET DAE operator command\n      requested that dump analysis and elimination (DAE) stop itself, then\n      start with changed parameters. The start failed.\n\n      In the message, text is one of the following:\n\n      STORAGE WAS NOT FREED FROM PREVIOUS SYMPTOM QUEUES. A NEW QUEUE CANNOT\n      BE BUILT\n          The cell pools that were obtained for a previous start cannot be\n          deleted. If the number of cell pools that are not freed reaches a\n          threshold, DAE cannot be started until the system is initialized\n          again.\n\n      MODULE ADYDFLT COULD NOT BE LOADED\n          The system could not load a required DAE module.\n\n      THE OPEN FOR dsname FAILED\n          The DAE data set could not be opened.\n\n          In the message text:\n\n          dsname\n              The data set name.\n\n      ALLOCATION FOR dsname FAILED RETURN CODE = return-code ERROR CODE =\n      error-code REASON CODE = reason-code\n          The DAE data set cannot be allocated. The return, error, and\n          reason codes describe the dynamic allocation error; see\n          Interpreting DYNALLOC return codes and Interpreting information\n          reason codes from DYNALLOC for an explanation of return and reason\n          codes for SVC 99. These codes are missing if the allocation ended\n          abnormally.\n\n          In the message text:\n\n          dsname\n              The data set name.\n\n          return-code\n              The return code.\n\n          errc\n              The error code.\n\n          reason-code\n              The reason code.\n\n      I/O ERROR OCCURRED WHILE READING dsname SYNAD DATA = yyy\n          An I/O error occurred while reading the DAE data set.\n\n          In the message text:\n\n          dsname\n              The data set name.\n\n          yyy\n              The SYNAD data returned from the error.

See the SYNADAF macro of the Data Facility\n              Product (DFP) for information about the SYNAD data.\n\n      ALLOCATION FOR dsname FAILED. THE DATA SET COULD NOT BE FOUND.\n          The DAE data set cannot be dynamically allocated.

For an abend, the system\n      writes a dump.\n\n      Operator response\n\n      If requested by the system programmer, enter the SET DAE command.

A NEW QUEUE CANNOT\n      BE BUILT MODULE ADYDFLT COULD NOT BE LOADED\n          Ensure that system initialization occurred correctly.
