{"heading":"ATR305E RRS IS UNABLE TO WRITE TO lstype\n         LOGSTREAM logstreamname ON SYSTEM sysname","followUp":null,"content":"      Explanation\n\n      RRS cannot write to the log stream identified in this message\n      because RRS encountered an error when using the system logger\n      IXGWRITE macro.\n\n      Message ATR216I accompanies this message, which provides the\n      specific diagnostic information.\n\n      In the message text:\n\n      lstype\n          Identifies the log stream type as one of the following:\n\n          RM DATA\n\n          MAIN UR\n\n          DELAYED UR\n\n          RESTART\n\n          ARCHIVE\n\n          RM META DATA\n\n      logstreamname\n          The name of the log stream.\n\n      sysname\n          The system name on which the error was encountered\n\n      System action\n\n      The action varies with the type of log stream that encountered the\n      write error. The actions based upon the lstype are:\n\n      RM DATA\n          If RRS was initializing when the error occurred and RRS needed to\n          update the log to complete initialization, then RRS initialization\n          fails.\n\n          Otherwise, any RRS function that must update the RM DATA log\n          stream will fail. These functions include log takeover processing\n          for another system and RM restarts. RRS will continue to attempt\n          to write to the RM DATA log stream on subsequent requests that\n          require updates to the log. If a write succeeds, RRS will delete\n          this message.\n\n      MAIN UR\n          RRS stops logging to the MAIN UR log stream on system sysname. All\n          UR state log records for sysname are logged to the DELAYED UR log\n          stream for the remainder of the life of the RRS address space on\n          sysname.\n\n      DELAYED UR\n          RRS address space on system sysname terminates.\n\n      RESTART\n          RRS functions that must update the RESTART log fail. These\n          functions include log takeover, remove interest, and resolve an\n          in-doubt condition.\n\n      ARCHIVE\n          RRS stops logging to the ARCHIVE log stream on system sysname for\n          the remainder of the life of the RRS address space on sysname.\n\n      RM META DATA\n          RRS functions that update the RM Meta Data log stream may fail.\n          These function include set meta data, remove/delete RM, and Meta\n          Data log compression. RRS will continue to attempt to write to the\n          RM Meta Data log stream on subsequent requests that require\n          updates to the log stream. If a write succeeds, RRS will delete\n          this message.\n\n      This message will be deleted when the RRS address space terminates.\n\n      Operator response\n\n      Locate message ATR216I and notify the system programmer.\n\n      System programmer response\n\n      The response varies with the type of log stream, as follows:\n\n      RM DATA\n          You need to correct the error or cold start.\n\n          To correct the error, find message ATR216I and follow the system\n          programmer response for that message. Once RRS can write to the RM\n          data log stream, it will delete this message.\n\n          If you cannot correct the error, you must cold start all the RRS\n          members in the RRS group. The RRS group name is the second\n          qualifier in the log stream name. See z/OS MVS Programming:\n          Resource Recovery for a description of how to cold start RRS, and\n          for a description of some actions to avoid because they can cause\n          problems that require a cold start.\n\n      MAIN UR\n          You can either try to fix the problem or have RRS run without\n          logging to the MAIN UR log stream.\n\n          Fixing the problem: If you try to fix the problem, you will need\n          to determine the error condition returned by the system logger.\n          Locate message ATR216I and follow the system programmer response\n          for that message. Then, cancel RRS on system sysname and restart\n          it to have it begin using the log stream again.\n\n          If you cannot correct the problem and you want to have RRS use the\n          MAIN UR log stream, you will need to cancel RRS and start RRS with\n          a different log group name.\n\n          Running without a MAIN UR log stream: If you choose to run RRS\n          without logging to the MAIN UR log stream, you need to consider\n          the impact on RRS performance.\n\n          Because system sysname is now logging all its UR state log entries\n          to the DELAYED UR log stream, as opposed to both the MAIN UR and\n          DELAYED UR log streams, the amount of data in the DELAYED UR log\n          stream will increase. Consider monitoring the DELAYED UR log\n          stream to ensure the log stream does not run out of log data set\n          directory space. You can use the LOGR policy utility LIST function\n          to monitor the log data set usage. You might also consider\n          formatting DSEXTENT records in your LOGR couple data set if you\n          have not already done so. This action will allow the log stream to\n          extend its log data set directory, if necessary.\n\n      DELAYED UR\n          Determine the error condition returned by the system logger.\n          Locate message ATR216I and follow the system programmer response\n          for that message to correct the problem, then restart the RRS\n          address space on sysname.\n\n          If you cannot correct the problem, consider starting RRS with a\n          different log group name.\n\n      RESTART\n          Determine the error condition returned by the system logger.\n          Locate message ATR216I and follow the system programmer response\n          for that message to correct the problem. Once RRS can successfully\n          write to the RESTART log stream on sysname, it deletes this\n          message.\n\n          If you cannot correct the problem, consider either deleting and\n          redefining the RESTART log stream or starting RRS with a different\n          log group name. In either case, you will need to bring down all\n          members of the RRS group, redefine (define) the log stream(s), and\n          then restart the members of the RRS group.\n\n      ARCHIVE\n          You can either try to fix the problem or have RRS run without\n          logging to the ARCHIVE log stream.\n\n          Fixing the problem: If you try to fix the problem, locate message\n          ATR216I to determine the error condition the system logger\n          returned and follow the system programmer response for that\n          message. Then, cancel RRS on system sysname and restart it to have\n          it begin using the log stream again.\n\n          If you cannot correct the problem and you want to have RRS use the\n          ARCHIVE log stream, you will need to cancel RRS and start RRS with\n          a different group name.\n\n          Running without an ARCHIVE log stream: If you choose to run\n          without an ARCHIVE log stream, RRS will not log completed units of\n          recovery (URs) to the ARCHIVE log stream.\n\n      RM META DATA\n          Determine the error condition returned by the system logger.\n          Locate message ATR216I and follow the system programmer response\n          for that message to correct the problem. Once RRS can successfully\n          write to the RM META DATA log stream on sysname, RRS deletes this\n          message.\n\n          If you cannot correct the problem, consider either deleting and\n          redefining the RM META DATA log stream or restarting RRS with a\n          different RRS log group name. In either case, you will need to\n          bring down all members of the RRS group, redefine (define) the log\n          stream (s) and then restart the members of the RRS log group.\n\n      Module\n\n      ATRLMLOG\n\n      Source\n\n      Resource Recovery Services (RRS)\n\n      Routing Code\n\n      1,2\n\n      Descriptor Code\n\n      12\n ","additional":[{"heading":"ATR216I RRS ENCOUNTERED AN ERROR WRITING TO LOGSTREAM lsname\n         RETURN CODE: return-code REASON CODE: reason-code\n         DIAGNOSTIC INFORMATION: diag1 diag2 diag3 diag4","copyright":"Text Below Copyright (c) 2023, IBM","followUp":"V=IBM P=Z/OS SYSTEM MSGS R=V2R5 I=ATR216I","content":"      Explanation\n\n      While trying to write to log stream lsname, RRS encountered the\n      error this message reports.
