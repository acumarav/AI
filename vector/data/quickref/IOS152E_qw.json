{"heading":"IOS152E IOS1152E DEVICE dev BOXED BY SUBCHANNEL RECOVERY,\n         DEVICE STATE UNKNOWN","followUp":null,"content":"  Explanation\n\n  The system does not know if a device is available or unavailable.\n\n  In making the device available, the system boxed the device because the\n  device is:\n\n      o Online\n\n      o Allocated\n\n      o In use by a system component\n\n      o A JES3 device that is assigned or reserved\n\n  In the message text:\n\n  dev\n      The device number.\n\n  System action\n\n  The system issues message IOS150I or IOS151I before this message. The\n  system marks the device boxed and not connected to the system, as follows:\n\n      o The I/O on the device is ended.\n\n      o Any new I/O requests result in permanent I/O errors.\n\n      o The system does not perform new allocations for the device.\n\n      o If the device was online, the system marks it pending offline. A\n        pending offline device goes offline when the following conditions\n        occur, in this order:\n\n          1.  The device is no longer allocated to any job.\n\n          2.  Allocation can get the necessary resources to process the\n              request.\n\n      o If the device was offline, it remains offline.\n\n  Operator response\n\n  To recover a boxed device, do the following:\n\n      1.  Vary the boxed device offline to all sharing systems.\n\n      2.  Isolate the failing control unit for repair.\n\n      3.  Determine the range of affected devices.\n\n      4.  Contact hardware support.\n\n      5.  Bring the device online to allow hardware support personnel to\n          verify the data on the boxed device. Do one of the following:\n\n          o Enter a DISPLAY U command to see if the device is one of the\n            following:\n\n            - Offline and boxed (F-BOX)\n\n            - Allocated and boxed (A-BOX)\n\n          o If the device is offline and boxed, vary the device online by\n            entering the following command:\n\n              VARY dev, ONLINE\n\n          o If the device is allocated and boxed, display the using job\n            steps that are allocated to the device by entering the following\n            command:\n\n              DISPLAY U,,ALLOC,dev,1\n\n            Follow your installation's procedures for unallocating using job\n            steps. Vary the device offline, using the following command:\n\n              VARY dev,OFFLINE\n\n            Vary the device online, using the following command:\n\n              VARY dev,ONLINE\n\n          o Verify the data on the volume.\n\n      6.
