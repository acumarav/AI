Delays in system logger service\n  tasks can impact not only the specific log stream, but also other log\n  streams on the system or in the sysplex.\n\n  In the message text:\n\n  group\n      is the name of the group that the service task belongs to (either\n      PRODUCTION or TEST)\n\n  taskname\n      is the name of the system logger service task that is not responding.\n      The task is either ALLOCATION, CONNECTION, LOGSTREAM MISC or MIGRATED\n      DATASET\n\n  seconds\n      is the number of seconds that the task has not responded.\n\n  logstream\n      is the log stream name.\n\n  staging\n      is the word STAGING or null.\n\n  dsname\n      is the log stream data set name.\n\n  diag\n      is the internal Diagnostic Data where the hexadecimal ranges\n      below followed by the decimal values indicate the type of\n      activity that system logger is waiting on to complete:\n\n          X'01'-X'0A' (1-10) Dynamic Allocation/Unallocation\n\n          X'0B'-X'14' (11-20) Serialization/Latching\n\n          X'15'-X'1E' (21-30) Catalog Accesses\n\n          X'1F'-X'32' (31-50) Media Manager OPEN/CONNECT\n\n          X'33'-X'46' (51-70) Media Manager CLOSE/DISCONNECT\n\n          X'47'-X'50' (71-80) Media Manager I/O Accesses\n\n          X'51'-X'5A' (81-90) Migrated Data Set Recall\n\n          X'5B'-X'64' (91-100) Migrated Data Set Delete\n\n  System action\n\n  System logger will prompt the operator for action with message IXG272E. If\n  the operator makes no response, the data set request might still finish\n  normally. If this occurs, system logger will issue a DOM for both IXG271I\n  and IXG272E messages and continues processing. Until the data set request\n  completes, system logger on this system might not be able to process many\n  functions such as log stream connect, disconnect, deletion requests,\n  offloads, or browses.\n\n  When the taskname is MIGRATED DATASET, the resource information for the\n  log stream and data set identifies the oldest recall request outstanding\n  for that group. Note that the PRODUCTION group can have up to 24 recall\n  requests waiting for DFSMShsm to respond, and the TEST group can have up\n  to 8 recalls. If any of the waiting recalls complete, system logger will\n  issue a DOM for both IXG271I and IXG272E messages and continue processing.\n  Message IXG281I may also be issued indicating system logger has data set\n  recall requests pending.\n\n  Operator response\n\n  Check for any conditions in the installation that might be preventing the\n  task from proceeding.\n\n      1.  Check for outstanding WTOs or WTORs.\n\n          Check for any outstanding WTORs or WTOs that are awaiting action\n          that might be preventing system logger from being able to allocate\n          a log data set.\n\n      2.  Check for start pendings.\n\n          Check for any start pending conditions against either the DASD\n          device or any devices required to allocate or unallocate log data\n          sets, such as the catalog device and any device for which a new\n          log data set could be allocated. If start pending conditions are\n          found for any of these devices, resolve the condition.\n\n      3.  Check for resource contention.\n\n          Issue the DISPLAY GRS,C command to display resource contention. If\n          there is resource contention that is preventing system logger from\n          allocating log data sets, then resolve the contention.\n\n      4.  Check for recall of migrated log data sets.\n\n          Issue the DISPLAY LOGGER,STATUS,RECALLS command to display all the\n          outstanding data set recalls requested by system logger, and\n          consider using the SETLOGR FORCE,NORECALL command to cause system\n          logger to stop waiting for a particular data set to be recalled.\n\n  Resolve any recall requests for migrated log data sets.\n\n  If none of the above steps resolves the problem, notify the system pro\n  grammer.\n\n  System programmer response\n\n  See also message IXG272E documentation.\n\n  User response\n\n  None.\n\n  Programmer response\n\n  None.\n\n  Source\n\n  System logger (SCLOG)\n\n  Module\n\n  IXGL2MON\n\n  Routing code\n\n  2,10\n\n  Descriptor code\n\n  7,11\n ","additional":[]},{"heading":null,"copyright":"Text Below Copyright (c) 2023, IBM","followUp":"V=IBM P=Z/OS SYSTEM MSGS R=V2R5 I=IXG601I","content":" *****************************************************************************\n >>>>>>>>>     Multiple item definitions exist for this item         <<<<<<<<<\n *****************************************************************************\n  IXG601I hh.mm.ss LOGGER DISPLAY .id.\n\n   Explanation\n\n   When the operator enters the DISPLAY LOGGER command, this message displays\n   information about system logger.\n\n   The first line of the message always appears in each variation of the\n   display message to be shown.\n\n   See the Display Logger command in z/OS MVS System Commands for information\n   displayed in the various forms of the IXG601I message output.\n\n   In the message text:\n\n   hh.mm.ss\n       The hour, minute and second at which the system processed the display\n       command. 00.00.00 appears in this field if the time-of-day (TOD) clock\n       is not working.\n\n   id\n       A decimal identifier used with the CONTROL C,D command to cancel\n       status displays that are written on typewriter or printer consoles or\n       displayed inline on a display console.
