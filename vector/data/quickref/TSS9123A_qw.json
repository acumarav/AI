If BLP appears after\nthe \"system\", the initial system is in the process of backing up the security\nfile.\n\nIf the system holding the resource has gone down, replying RESET recovers the\nSecurity File lock.\n\nReplying WAIT retries the request a set number of times. If none of the retries\nare successful, TSS9123A is reissued.\n\nIf the message is issued for the security file lock and the security file lock\nrecord is being maintained in the coupling facility, then the system will be\nidentified as $CFLOCK$ in the message. The number of minutes the lock has been\nheld will be unreliable.\n\nAction:\n\nReply with desired option: RESET or WAIT. The correct response to the message\nis WAIT unless all live systems sharing the Security File have been issued the\nTSS9123A message as well. When all systems have the message, respond RESET on\nthe first system and WAIT on the remaining systems.\n\nIf no response is received after one minute has elapsed, Top Secret will\nautomatically reply to this message with WAIT.\n\nIf you set up an automated reply to message TSS9123A:\n\no Do not automate a reply of RESET. This will cause security file corruption.\n\no Ensure that an automated WAIT response is not issued under the same subtask\n  that issued the WTOR for the message. This may cause a system outage. For\n  example, the OPS/MVS AOF facility allows for inline responses and is not\n  recommended. Generate the reply via the OPSCMD POI command processor. This\n  allows the command to be issued from an OPS/MVS OSF server and not the\n  subtask that issued the message.","additional":[]}
