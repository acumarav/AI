As a result, Accessor Environment Element (ACEE)\ninformation is not being stored in the XREF table (and is stored only for the\nindividual terminal session). Without accurate ACEE information in the XREF\ntable, ACEE refresh might not work.\n\nAdditionally, unless the address space is running as a started task, ACEE\nstorage could be left allocated at address space termination. This message is\nissued once per address space.\n\nIn an IMS control region, the XREF table is limited to 51 entries. When MAXUSER\nis exceeded during a signon attempt, the product signs off the oldest sign-on\nuser (based on ACEE information), signs on the user who is requesting signon,\nand issues this message once. After the XREF table becomes full, any user\nsignons allocate the logon storage in 31-bit Common Service Area that will not\nbe recovered until an IPL.\n\nAction:\n\nIf the multi-user address space is not running as a started task, stop and\nrestart the initiator to reclaim the allocated private storage for user\nsignons. Increase the MASTFAC facility MAXUSER parameter appropriately (based\non the number of simultaneous end users who will be signed on to the address\nspace), then recycle the address space job to activate the new parameter.\n\nNote: For the IMS control region, no action is required.","additional":[]}
