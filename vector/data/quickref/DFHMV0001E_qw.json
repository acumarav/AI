However, the SVC return code was nonzero both\n times. The message inserts identify the functional area concerned (R0IN),\n the SVC number, and the inputs and outputs.\n\n System action\n CICS termination continues. Subsequently, other CICS regions might encounter\n severe errors in the functional area for which termination clean-up has\n failed.\n\n User response\n Inform the system programmer. Keep any dumps, the system log, and the output\n from the failing job. If other CICS systems are being seriously degraded by\n persistent errors in the functional area affected, it is usually necessary\n to re-IPL MVS to correct the problem.\n\n Module\n DFHMVRMS\n\n Destination\n Console","additional":[]}
