{"heading":"IWM011I WLM CROSS SYSTEM RECOVERY IN PROGRESS BY SYSTEM system- name1\n         FOR SYSTEM system-name2","followUp":null,"content":"  Explanation\n\n  Cross system recovery is in progress on another system.\n\n  In the message text:\n\n  system-name1\n      The name of the system performing the cross system recovery.\n\n  system-name2\n      The name of the system for which the cross system recovery\n      is being done.\n\n  System action\n\n  Processing continues.\n\n  Operator response\n\n  If the message comes up and goes away within a short amount\n  of time, cross-system recovery actions were completed\n  successfully.\n\n  If this message persists, a problem may have occurred during\n  cross-system recovery, preventing reinitialization of the\n  failed system. You cannot re-IPL the failed system before\n  cross-system recovery has completed because the system\n  performing the cross-system recovery holds resources\n  belonging to the failed system.\n\n  In the case where this message does not go away, you will\n  have to determine how crucial bringing up the failed system\n  is to your installation because in order to bring up the\n  failed system you will have to shut down the system\n  performing the cross-system recovery on behalf of the failed\n  system. Another consideration is the importance of the work\n  running on the system doing the cross-system recovery.\n\n  To bring up the failed system, do the following:\n\n      o Take a system dump of the WLM address space by specifying\n        SDATA=WLM on the system doing the cross- system recovery and\n        contact the IBM support center.\n\n      o Re-IPL the system that was doing the cross-system recovery\n        to free up the resources that belong to the failed system.\n\n      o Re-IPL the failed system.\n\n  Source\n\n  Workload manager (WLM)\n\n  Module\n\n  IWMS2XRP\n\n  Routing code\n\n  2,11\n\n  Descriptor code\n\n  3","additional":[]}
