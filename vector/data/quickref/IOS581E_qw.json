A unit at one end of an optical interface\n  link has detected a failure in the link or in one of the units attached to\n  the link. As a result, data transfer across the link has stopped.\n\n  In the message text:\n\n  CHPID=nn | **\n      The reporting CHPID is not always associated with the actual link\n      incident and might just represent the CHPID that is used to report the\n      link incident. Therefore, never make the assumption that the reporting\n      CHPID is associated with the link incident; instead, the incident unit\n      should be analyzed by hardware support to determine the link incident\n      source.\n\n      \"**\" indicates the reporting source was not a channel path.\n\n  INCIDENT UNIT unit-ident\n      The unit that detected the failure. The unit-ident contains the\n      following fields:\n\n      o TM=tttttt/mdl SER=mmmpp-ssssss IF=xxxx\n\n        TM=tttttt/mdl\n            tttttt - machine type mdl - model number\n\n        SER=mmmpp-ssss\n            mmm - manufacturer pp - manufacturing plant ssssss - the\n            right-most six characters of the unit sequence number - commonly\n            known as the serial number\n\n        IF=xxxx\n            xxxx- physical interface number. This information is machine\n            type dependent. For additional information see the system\n            support documentation for that machine type and vendor, which\n            can contain information about the type of port, lcss and chpid\n            in use.\n\n  IC=yy\n      The incident code that identifies the type of incident that occurred.\n      This code is used by service personnel to help diagnose the problem.\n\n  INCIDENT UNIT logical interface ident\n      The unit that detected the problem. The logical interface ident\n      contains the following fields:\n\n      o LIF={zz | NOT APPLICABLE}\n\n        LIF={zz | NOT APPLICABLE}\n            If it is available and is applicable, the logical interface\n            number, zz, appears in this line. If the logical interface\n            number is available but is not applicable, NOT APPLICABLE\n            appears. If it is not available, this line is not displayed.\n\n  INCIDENT UNIT DATA COULD NOT BE OBTAINED\n      Either the incident unit could not be identified or it could be\n      identified but the information may not be current and cannot be\n      verified due to some problem, such as, loss of light.\n\n  ATTACHED UNIT unit-ident\n      The unit connected to the other end of the link.\n      (The contents of unit ident were described previously.)\n\n  ATTACHED UNIT logical interface ident\n      The unit connected to the other end of the link.\n      (The contents of logical interface ident were described previously.)\n\n  System action\n\n  The node is not operational.
