The CSECT contains a level identifier of wrong-level and the Db2\nthat is starting requires a level identifier of correct-level.\n\nThis error can occur if the system parameters load module specified is for a\ndifferent release of Db2. This error can also occur if the system parameters\nload module is missing some maintenance. In this case the parm-csect is down\nlevel and must be reassembled.\n\nSystem action\n\nDb2 subsystem startup processing stops.\n\nOperator response\n\nVerify that the correct system parameters name was specified. If the correct\nname was specified, then notify the system programmer.\n\nSystem programmer response\n\nVerify that:\n\no  The system parameters load module is for the release of Db2 being started.\n\no  The correct load libraries are being used to load the system parameters\n   load module.\n\nIf these are correct, then reassemble and relink-edit your system parameters\nload module.","additional":[]}
