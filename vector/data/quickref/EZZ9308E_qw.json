	"content": "Explanation\n\nThis message is issued when the resolver detects that the specified name\nserver failed to respond to a percentage of resolver queries. The percentage\nof failed resolver queries is in excess of the threshold that is specified by\nusing the UNRESPONSIVETHRESHOLD resolver setup statement.\n\nIn the message text:\n\nipaddress\n   The IPv4 or IPv6 network address of the name server that is considered\n   unresponsive.\n\nSystem action\n\nProcessing continues. The resolver continues to send queries to the name\nserver while the name server is specified in the TCPIP.DATA data sets used by\nthe installation.\n\nThe message remains on the operator console until one of the following\nevents occurs:\n\no  During a future monitor checkpoint, the percentage of resolver queries to\n   which the name server has failed to respond drops below the\n   UNRESPONSIVETHRESHOLD percentage.\n\no  You change the UNRESPONSIVETHRESHOLD value to zero by using the MODIFY\n   RESOLVER,REFRESH,SETUP=setup_file_name command. Changing the value of the\n   UNRESPONSIVETHRESHOLD parameter to zero disables the monitoring function,\n   so no additional EZZ9308E messages will be generated until the function is\n   re-enabled.\n\no  The resolver is stopped.\n\nOperator response\n\nContact the system programmer.\n\nSystem programmer response\n\nDetermine if the name server is unresponsive due to a network condition, a\nconfiguration error, or a temporary condition that might resolve itself\nlater.\n\no  If a network condition is preventing resolver requests or name server\n   responses from reaching the correct destination, correct the network\n   condition. When requests can successfully reach the name server and are\n   being responded to, the resolver will detect the change in responsiveness\n   at the next monitor interval and will clear the message from the operator\n   console.\n\no  If a configuration error is causing the name server to be unresponsive, use\n   resolver diagnostic tools such as MODIFY RESOLVER, DISPLAY or Trace\n   Resolver output to determine which TCPIP.DATA data sets are used in the\n   failing resolver queries and investigate the following possibilities:\n\n   -  If the UNRESPONSIVETHRESHOLD value specifies a lower percentage of\n      errors than your network can tolerate during typical operations,\n      increase the threshold percentage in the resolver setup file. For\n      example, if the threshold percentage is 25%, but your network can\n      tolerate 40%, increase the threshold to 40%-45%.\n\n   -  If the IP address is no longer valid as a destination name server,\n      remove the IP address from the list of name servers that were coded by\n      using the NSINTERADDR or NAMESERVER configuration statements.\n\n   -  If the RESOLVERTIMEOUT value is coded so small that the response is\n      unable to return from the name server within the specified time value,\n      increase the timeout setting to a value that permits a larger\n      percentage of responses to arrive within the timeout window.\n\n   When the configuration error is corrected, do one of the following to\n   cause the resolver to use the updated configuration information:\n\n   -  If you modified the setting of the UNRESPONSIVETHRESHOLD parameter, have\n      the operator issue the MODIFY RESOLVER,REFRESH,SETUP=setup_file_name\n      command.\n\n   -  If you modified the RESOLVERTIMEOUT parameter, or if you removed an IP\n      address from the list of name servers that were coded with the\n      NSINTERADDR or NAMESERVER statement, have the operator issue the MODIFY\n      RESOLVER,REFRESH command.\n\no  If you eliminated a network condition and a configuration error as the\n   reason for the message, then the resolver might be generating the message\n   for a temporary condition that might resolve itself. For example, the name\n   server might be having maintenance applied, or the name server might have\n   a very high percentage of failures because there were few queries sent to\n   the name server during the monitoring interval, so even a short network\n   interruption would severely impact the calculations. If this situation\n   repeats itself, an overly aggressive UNRESPONSIVETHRESHOLD value might be\n   contributing to the situation. Consider increasing the setting for the\n   UNRESPONSIVETHRESHOLD parameter in the resolver setup file, and then have\n   the operator issue the MODIFY RESOLVER,REFRESH, SETUP=setup_file_name\n   command to make the resolver less sensitive to name server response\n   failures.\n\nUser response\n\nNot applicable.\n\nProblem determination\n\nNot applicable.\n\nSource\n\nz/OS Communications Server TCP/IP: System Resolver\n\nModule\n\nRouting code\n\n2,8\n\nDescriptor code\n\n12\n\nAutomation\n\nThis message is a good candidate for automation. Automation can alert the\nnetwork operator to the condition, or it can trigger pro cessing to collect\ndiagnostics, or it can monitor future statistics related to the name server.\n\nExample\n\n  EZZ9308E UNRESPONSIVE NAME SERVER DETECTED AT IP ADDRESS 10.45.23.200",
