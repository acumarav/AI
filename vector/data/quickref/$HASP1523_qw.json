If necessary, start or restart\n      is required for z/OS functions, such as OMVS, TCP/IP, z/OSMF, and so\n      on. If necessary, update the z/OSMF configuration. In most cases, JES2\n      email processing restarts automatically. In some cases, for example,\n      if configuration change was required, manual intervention is required.\n      Use the JES2 $S EDS command to instruct JES2 email processing to try\n      communication again with the z/OSMF server.\n\n      Programmer response\n\n      If this is a persisting problem and cannot be resolved by updating the\n      configuration or activating the required z/OS functions, collect\n      diagnostic information and contact your IBM service representative.\n\n      Module\n\n      HASCEDS\n\n      Routing Code: 1, 2, 10, 42\n\n      Descriptor Code: 2, 7","additional":[]}
