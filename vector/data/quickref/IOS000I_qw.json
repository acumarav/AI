Sense data has been lost.\n\n   MEDIUM LENGTH ERROR\n       The currently mounted tape has a length that is not supported by\n       the device.\n\n   MEDIUM MANUALLY UNLOADED\n       The tape was manually unloaded from the drive while still in use.\n\n   OVERRUN\n       The data rate on the channel interface was insufficient to\n       sustain the data rate of the device.\n\n   PERMANENT ERROR-DEVICE REPORTED UNKNOWN MESSAGE CODE=xx\n       The device reported a message code that has not been defined to\n       the MVS Error Recovery Procedure.\n\n   POSITIONING LOST\n       A condition has occurred which has resulted in the loss of\n       volume integrity due to lost tape positioning\n\n   PROTECTION EXCEPTION\n       A supervisor-type command was issued in an unauthorized channel\n       program.\n\n   READ ERROR DETECTED\n       An unrecoverable error was detected while attempting to read a\n       data block or tapemark.\n\n   READ LENGTH ERROR\n       A READ command was issued for a data block whose length is not\n       supported by the device. The block might be too short or too long.\n\n   READ-ONLY FORMAT\n       An write-type command was issued but the device only supports\n       read-type commands on the currently mounted tape.\n\n   UNSUPPORTED FORMAT\n       A command was issued that attempted to read or write a format\n       that is not supported by the device.\n\n   UNSUPPORTED MEDIUM\n       The currently mounted tape medium is not supported by the device.\n\n   VOLUME IS NOT FORMATTED\n       A read-type command was issued to a tape which has not been\n       formatted for read-type operations. The tape might be blank or\n       written in a format that the device cannot recognize.\n\n   WRITE ERROR DETECTED\n       An unrecoverable error was detected while attempt ing to write a\n       data block or tapemark.\n\n   WRITE LENGTH ERROR\n       A write-type command was issued for a data block whose length is\n       not supported by the device. The block might be too short or too long.\n\n   WRITE PROTECTED\n       A write-type command was issued to a tape which is logically or\n       physically write-protected.\n\n   DEVICE HAS EXCEEDED LONG BUSY TIMEOUT\n       The device will be boxed.\n\n   PERMANENT ERROR - VOLUME FENCED\n       The job you are running ends. Deallocation will clear the\n       problem. If this error persists, contact the IBM Support Center.\n\n   PERMANENT ERROR - DEVICE REPORTED UNKNOWN MESSAGE CODE = cde\n       The device reported a unit check with sense data containing a\n       message code (cde) that was not recognized by host error\n       recovery procedures. The Host error recovery procedures may be\n       down-level or the error could be due to a microcode problem.\n\n   UNABLE TO OBTAIN SENSE DATA FROM THE DEVICE\n       For some tape drives, a two-line message is issued if there was\n       a unit check but IOS was unable to obtain sense data from the device.\n\n   REQUEST TERMINATED, EXCESSIVE RETRIES\n       DASD ERP has a loop detector to prevent an infinite number of\n       ERP entries. If a count of 2048 retries is detected, the I/O\n       request is terminated with a permanent error indication.\n\n   LIMITED SHARED ACCESS VIOLATION\n       The device has the Limited Shared Access Facility enabled at the\n       control unit. While the device was in use by another host\n       operating system, a tape motion command which could have\n       compromised data integrity was issued to the device by the\n       current host operating system. The current host's tape motion\n       command is rejected. If this command had been issued by an\n       application job step, it would normally result in an abend of\n       the step. The job on the first host will continue without\n       disruption until an unload occurs or a new tape is loaded, or\n       the first host loses all paths to the device or varies the\n       device offline. This violation may occur when the device sharing\n       is managed via software which bypasses control unit assists.\n\n   VOLUME IS NOT FORMATTED\n       A read-type command was issued to a tape which has not been\n       formatted for read-type operations. The tape might be blank or\n       written in a format that the device cannot recognize.\n\n   ENCRYPTION FAILURE CU=XX DRIVE=XXXXXX EKM=XXXXXX\n       If an encryption-related key exchange between the drive and the\n       key manager fails, an IOS000I message is issued indicating that\n       an encryption failure has occurred. The control unit (CU), DRIVE,\n       and Encryption Key Manager (EKM) error codes are from sense\n       bytes 08, 13-15, and 17-19 respectively. For an EKM failure, see\n       the Problem Determination section of the IBM System Storage\n       Tape Encryption Key Manager, Introduction, Planning, and User's\n       Guide, GA76-0418. When looking up the EKM failure, use the last\n       four byes of the error code. For a control unit (CU) failure,\n       see the IBM System Storage TS1130 Tape Drive and TS1120 Tape\n       Drive and Controller Operator Guide, GA32-0556. For more\n       detailed information about the drive-reported conditions, and\n       also about the EKM-reported conditions, see the Problem\n       Determination section of the IBM System Storage TS3500 Tape\n       Library Operator Guide, GA32-0560.\n\n       For more information, see z/OS DFSMS Software Support for IBM\n       System Storage TS1140, TS1130, and TS1120 Tape Drives (3592).\n\n   IMMEDIATE MODE COPY.EXPECTED|UNEXPECTED. FAILURE\n   REASON CODE = ZZCOPY COUNTXX OF YY COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY\n       At lease one required Immediate Mode Copy for the volume could\n       not be completed. This can be EXPECTED or UNEXPECTED. Expected\n       reasons can occur because of scheduled maintenance on a TS7700\n       Virtualization Engine. REASON CODE is obtained from Sense Byte\n       19. COPY COUNT is obtained from Sense Byte 18. XX is between\n       bits 4 to 7 and YY is between bits 0 to 3.\n\n   WORM OVERWRITE REJECTED\n       A write-type command was attempted to overwrite existing data on\n       a physical or logical WORM volume.\n\n   VOLUME SOFT FENCED\n       Device is in a soft fenced state which prevents unintended\n       access (reads and writes) to the volume. See Device Support\n       Facilities (ICKDSF) User's Guide and Reference for additional\n       information on how to use the ICKDSF CONTROL with the CLEARFENCE\n       parameter to reset the soft fenced setting.\n\n   VOLUME SPID FENCED\n       Device is in an SPID fenced state. This state prevents the\n       device from unintentionally going online. See Device Support\n       Facilities (ICKDSF) User's Guide and Reference for information\n       about how to clear the SPID fence condition.\n\n       Example:\n\n       IOS000I D8C4,68,SPF,03,0E00,,0000000A,IND8C4,PEETEXCP,\n       8000000002FFFF0F7C00000000000004E51833AFF3000F0F000040F000000000\n       VOLUME SPID FENCED\n\n   SPID TOKEN MISMATCH\n       Host token that is specified in the Perform Storage Controller\n       Action order Set SPID Fence or Reset SPID Fence does not match\n       the saved SPID Fence Token for the device.\n\n       Example:\n\n       IOS000I D8C4,68,SPF,03,0E00,,0000000A,IND8C4,PEETEXCP,\n       8000000002FFFF0F7D00000000000004E51833AFF3000F0F000040F000000000\n       SPID TOKEN MISMATCH\n\n   VOLUME READ-ONLY\n       A write-type command was issued to a DASD volume which is\n       defined as read-only on this system.\n\n   System action\n\n   For magnetic tape devices, the results of the operation are\n   unpredictable. This message warns that the system might fail. If\n   CMD appears in the err field, the system rejects the command.\n\n   Operator response\n\n   Do the following:\n\n       o Isolate the failing storage director. Contact hardware\n         support to repair it.\n\n       o If only one functional path remains, transfer critical\n         applications to backup.\n\n       o Isolate the failing control unit. Contact hardware support\n         to repair it.\n\n       o Identify and recover failing tasks.\n\n       o Notify the Storage Administrator.\n\n       o Depending on the value of err, one of the following:\n\n       CMD\n           Correct and retry the command. If the command is FF,\n           a hardware error occurred.\n\n       OVR, BOC, EQC, IOC, or ICC\n           Contact hardware support.\n\n       DCK\n           Request an alternate utility program to perform\n           recovery/replace functions and assign an alternate track.
