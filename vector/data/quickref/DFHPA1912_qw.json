SPECIFY\nCORRECT SIT OVERRIDE.","followUp":null,"content":"Explanation\n\nThis message is displayed if a keyword specified in the\ninput override parameter stream is invalid, and the\nPARMERR=INTERACT option is specified in the SIT, or\nas an override. The insert keyword is the invalid\nkeyword. Note that PARMERR=INTERACT is the\ndefault action for invalid SIT overrides.\n\nDuring initialization, CICS might not have access to the\nuser's applid coded in the SIT. If CICS produces this\nmessage in these circumstances, it uses the default\napplid value DBDCCICS.\n\nSystem action\n\nCICS waits for the corrected override to be entered on\nthe console by the operator, and analyzes this\noverride.\n\nUser response\n\nOn the console enter the corrected SIT override,\nbypass the override in error and all overrides that\nfollow by typing '.END', or supply a blank line to\nbypass only the override in error.\n\nTo enter lowercase data, start the System Command\nExtension function by typing a / by itself on the SDSF\ncommand line, or by adding a trailing + to a /\ncommand, then enter the override enclosing both the\nkeyword and data in apostrophes, remembering that\nthe keyword itself must be in uppercase. The\ncommand is still echoed in uppercase in the job log,\nbut SDSF processes the value in mixed case.\n\nModule:\n\nDFHPADM\n\nDestination\n\nConsole","additional":[]}
