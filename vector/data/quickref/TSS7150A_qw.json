There are two\ninstances that cause this error message:\n\nReason 1:\n\nIf the TSS7150A message is issued at startup and the started task (STC) ACID\nhas a password, ensure that OPTIONS(4) is set in the Top Secretparmfile. We\nrecommend that all STC ACIDs have a password and OPTIONS(4) set in the Top\nSecret parmfile. OPTIONS(4) eliminates the prompt for a password when the STC\nstarts, but if a user attempts to sign on with the STC ACID, the user is\nprompted for the password.\n\nAction 1:\n\nEnter the password associated with the ACID and Started Task. When entering a\nmixed case response, enclose the text in single quotes.\n\nReason 2:\n\nIf the TSS7150A message is issued when a user attempts to sign on to the\napplication and enters the wrong password, the STC ACID needs a MASTFAC added\nto it. The MASTFAC must point to the facility to be used for the application.\n\nAction 2:\n\nChoose the facility to be used for the application and add it as a MASTFAC to\nthe STC ACID: TSS ADD(stc_acid) MASTFAC(facname)\n\nThe facname must be the name of the facility associated with the STC. The\nfacility must also be added to the users that sign on, an attached profile, or\nthe ALL record if everyone is allowed access:\n\n TSS ADD(acid) FAC(facname)\n\nYou can create your own facility or use an existing facility. You must recycle\nthe STC to pick up the MASTFAC.","additional":[]}
