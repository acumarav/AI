{"heading":"CSFM137E coprocessor-name cii, SN nnnnnnn STATUS CHANGED FROM oldreason\n           TO newreason.","followUp":null,"content":" Explanation\n\n A cryptographic feature is inactive and its status has changed. When the\n type of coprocessor could not be determined, a coprocessor-name of UNKNOWN\n FEATURE is used. The substitution variables are:\n\n o  coprocessor-name - the cryptographic feature name and how it is\n    configured. Possible values are:\n\n    -  CRYPTO EXPRESS2 ACCELERATOR\n\n    -  CRYPTO EXPRESS2 COPROCESSOR\n\n    -  CRYPTO EXPRESS3 ACCELERATOR\n\n    -  CRYPTO EXPRESS3 COPROCESSOR\n\n    -  CRYPTO EXPRESS4 ACCELERATOR\n\n    -  CRYPTO EXPRESS4 COPROCESSOR\n\n    -  CRYPTO EXPRESS5 ACCELERATOR\n\n    -  CRYPTO EXPRESS5 COPROCESSOR\n\n    -  CRYPTO EXPRESS6 ACCELERATOR\n\n    -  CRYPTO EXPRESS6 COPROCESSOR\n\n    -  CRYPTO EXPRESS7 ACCELERATOR\n\n    -  CRYPTO EXPRESS7 COPROCESSOR\n\n|   -  CRYPTO EXPRESS8 COPROCESSOR\n\n|   -  CRYPTO EXPRESS8 ACCELERATOR\n\n    -  UNKNOWN FEATURE\n\n o  c - the short name for the cryptographic feature type. Possible values are:\n\n    -  2C (representing a CEX2C)\n\n    -  2A (representing a CEX2A)\n\n    -  3C (representing a CEX3C)\n\n    -  3A (representing a CEX3A)\n\n    -  4A (representing a CEX4A)\n\n    -  4C (representing a CEX4C)\n\n    -  4P (representing a CEX4P)\n\n    -  5A (representing a CEX5A)\n\n    -  5C (representing a CEX5C)\n\n    -  5P (representing a CEX5P)\n\n    -  6A (representing a CEX6A)\n\n    -  6C (representing a CEX6C)\n\n    -  6P (representing a CEX6P)\n\n    -  7A (representing a CEX7A)\n\n    -  7C (representing a CEX7C)\n\n    -  7P (representing a CEX7P)\n\n|   -  8A (representing a CEX8A)\n\n|   -  8C (representing a CEX8C)\n\n|   -  8P (representing a CEX8P)\n\n o  ii - the index or position where the cryptographic feature is installed.\n\n o  nnnnnnn or N/A - the serial number for the cryptographic feature, or N/A\n    when the feature is configured as an accelerator.\n\n o  oldreason - the previous reason why the feature is inactive.\n\n o  newreason - the new reason why the feature is inactive. Possible values\n    are:\n\n Deactivated\n    The feature has been deactivated by the ICSF administrator from the\n    Coprocessor Management panel or by the operator on the system console.\n\n Disabled by TKE\n    The feature has been removed from service by the ICSF administrator on a\n    TKE workstation.\n\n Master key incorrect\n    At least one master key is incorrect. When all master keys are correct,\n    the feature will become active.\n\n Offline\n    The feature was configured offline at the support element. The feature is\n    not available to ICSF.\n\n Busy\n    The cryptographic feature is busy performing maintenance functions. This\n    state may occur when the cryptographic feature is first brought online and\n    is going through power-on reset. The cryptographic feature may also be in\n    this state when new licensed internal code is being loaded or when the\n    unit is going through recovery processing.\n\n Being reconfigured\n    An error has been detected and the ICSF configuration task has been\n    invoked to check the feature. The feature may become active if the error\n    is resolved or may stay inactive if the error is not resolved.\n\n Hardware error\n    The feature has failed. Have the feature removed or replaced by your IBM\n    customer engineer.\n\n Initializing stage 1\n    A newly online feature has been detected by ICSF and ICSF is starting the\n    initialization process.\n\n Initializing stage 2\n    A newly online feature or active feature is being reset by ICSF as part of\n    the initialization process or recovery process.\n\n Initializing stage 3\n    A newly online feature or inactive feature is being readied to process\n    requests.\n\n User hung on latch\n    A feature is not responding and the configuration task is attempting to\n    obtain the feature latch so the feature can be reset. One or more users\n    hold the latch.\n\n Bad feature response\n    An unexpected response was received from a feature. The feature is\n    unusable.\n\n Retry limit reached\n    While initializing a feature, the limit of attempts to gather\n    status/information was reached. The feature is unusable. ICSF will try\n    again to acquire status.\n\n No feature present\n    No feature was detected at this index.\n\n Unknown response\n    The feature has returned a return code reason code combination that ICSF\n    does not recognize.\n\n Unknown feature type\n    A feature has a type that is not recognized by ICSF. The feature is\n    unusable.\n\n System action\n\n ICSF will not use the cryptographic feature for cryptographic operations.\n\n Operator response\n\n Contact the ICSF administrator.\n\n System programmer response\n\n Contact the ICSF administrator.","additional":[]}
