{"heading":"DFHSM0133 applid CICS is under stress (short\non storage above 16MB).","followUp":null,"content":"Explanation\n\nThere is a shortage of storage in one of the dynamic\nstorage areas (DSAs) above 16MB. Either the largest\nfree area in one of the DSAs is less than the size of the\ninternally defined cushion for that DSA, or there is at\nleast one transaction suspended due to insufficient\ncontiguous free storage.\n\nSystem action\n\nAn exception entry is made in the trace table to record\nthe event.\n\nCICS continues to operate but takes steps to alleviate\nthe situation by, for example, slowing down the rate at\nwhich new tasks are started and by releasing storage\noccupied by programs which are not currently in use.\n\nUser response\n\nNo immediate action is required. However, if the\nproblem persists you could, if possible, increase the\nvalue of the EDSALIMIT parameter, or reduce the\nstorage requirements of your CICS system above\n16MB. For guidance on how to do this, see the\nImproving performance.\n\nModule:\n\nDFHSMSY\nXMEOUT parameters/Message inserts\n\n  1. applid\n\nDestination\n\nConsole","additional":[]}
