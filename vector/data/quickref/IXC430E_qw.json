{"heading":"IXC430E SYSTEM sysname HAS STALLED XCF GROUP MEMBERS","followUp":null,"content":"  Explanation\n\n  The indicated system has one or more members of an XCF group that are not\n  processing their XCF work in a timely manner. The XCF work to be performed\n  by a group member includes such thing s as processing of messages by a\n  message user exit routine, or processing of group events by a group user\n  exit routine.\n\n  A member is declared stalled if there is any one work item that is not\n  being processed in a timely manner. A stalled member could be processing\n  all its other XCF work in a timely manner. See the explanation of message\n  IXC431I for a description of situations that could make a member appear\n  stalled.\n\n  Note: It is very unlikely that the delays are caused by a problem in XCF.\n\n  It may not be possible to determine the impact to the sysplex, system, or\n  relevant application without understanding the type and nature of the work\n  item(s) experiencing the delay. The impact may not be limited to the\n  stalled member if it provides services to other applications or subsystems\n  the sysplex. Failure to process this work in a timely manner could account\n  for delays or performance problems elsewhere in the sysplex.\n\n  This message is not necessarily issued if the stalled member happens to be\n  an internal XCF member.\n\n  In the message text:\n\n  sysname\n      The name of the system on which the stalled members reside.\n\n  System action\n\n  XCF continues to monitor the situation. The message is deleted\n  when no member stalled conditions exist on the indicated system.\n\n  Messages IXC431I and IXC432I may be issued periodically to the\n  log to provide information about the current state of the stall\n  for a particular group member. XCF may issue abend x00C reason\n  x020F0006 to initiate internal XCF self verification and other\n  actions to address the stall. The abend does not directly impact\n  the stalled application. If an internal XCF problem is discovered,\n  a dump will be taken. An entry in logrec is made to document the\n  situation even if no dump is taken.\n\n  Operator response\n\n  Monitor the situation.

On many occasions the system will\n  successfully resolve the situation during the course of normal processing.\n  Issue DISPLAY XCF commands on the indicated system to get more information\n  about the stalled group members.\n\n      o Use DISPLAY XCF,GROUP to determine which groups have a stalled\n        member on the system. Message IXC331I lists the names of the groups\n        and indicates which ones have stalled members.\n\n      o Use DISPLAY XCF,GROUP,grpname to determine which members of group\n        grpname are stalled. Message IXC332I lists the names of the members\n        and indicates which ones are considered stalled by XCF.\n\n      o Use DISPLAY XCF,GROUP,grpname,membername to get detailed information\n        about the member membername of group grpname. Message IXC333I\n        provides status information about the member and indicates what work\n        appears to be stalled.\n\n  There may be other commands provided by the stalled application/subsystem\n  that will allow you to determine its status and/or alleviate the problem.\n  At the direction of the system programmer, you may need to obtain dumps\n  for problem diagnosis and/or terminate the indicated application.

Before terminating the application, issue the DISPLAY\n  XCF,GROUP grpname, ALL command as well as any application specific display\n  commands that may be helpful in ascertaining status. Then collect the\n  following diagnostic information: system log, application log, and an\n  appropriate dump. In addition to application specific diagnostic data, the\n  dump should include XCF data (SDATA=COUPLE).

The processing of at least one work item appears to be stalled.\n\n  Note: It is very unlikely that the delays are caused by a problem in XCF.\n  Possible explanations include:\n\n      o Contention problems in the user exit routine(s). Perhaps the exit\n        routine is suspended waiting to obtain the local lock or a latch.\n        DISPLAY GRS,C will identify latch contention.\n\n      o SRBs not dispatched in a timely manner. Perhaps the member address\n        space is swapped out or a dump is in progress. Perhaps the dispatch\n        priority of the member address space is too low. Perhaps a loop in\n        some other work unit is consuming most of the CPU resource. The\n        looping work unit need not be in the member address space. It could\n        be in an address space other than those identified by the IXC431I\n        message(s).\n\n      o An influx of work has exceeded the processing capacity of the member\n        or system. The influx may be a temporary spike that the system can\n        work through with time. It could be the residual effect of some\n        other problem that caused processing of an otherwise normal workload\n        to be delayed.\n\n      o Some other member or system in the sysplex is not processing its\n        work in a timely manner. Although XCF may have identified the\n        indicated member as stalled, the situation could be the result of\n        sympathy sickness arising from processing delays elsewhere in the\n        sysplex (which may or may not have been identified).\n\n      o A member or system might be engaged in reconfiguration or recovery\n        processes that must complete before normal processing can proceed.\n        For example, a system may have just become active in the sysplex, a\n        system may have just been removed from the sysplex, a member may be\n        joining the group, a member may be leaving the group, or some other\n        application specific processes may be running.\n\n      o The user exit routine may have a coding error in which it returns to\n        the dispatcher instead of returning to XCF. One would expect this\n        situation to occur only when testing a new application that exploits\n        XCF services.\n\n  It may not be possible to determine the impact to the application without\n  understanding the nature and content of the item(s) experiencing the\n  delay. The impact may not be limited to the stalled member if it provides\n  services to other applications or subsystems in the sysplex. Failure to\n  process this work in a timely manner could account for delays or\n  performance problems elsewhere in the sysplex.\n\n  If multiple members appear to be stalled, or if other indicators suggest\n  work is not being processed, check the status of the system because there\n  may be an underlying problem affecting them all.\n\n  In the message text:\n\n  gnme\n      The name of the XCF group whose member stalled.\n\n  mnme\n      The name of the stalled member.\n\n  jnme\n      The name of the job.\n\n  asid\n      The hexadecimal ASID of the address space.\n\n  sdate\n      The date when XCF believes the member stalled.\n\n  stime\n      The time when XCF believes the member stalled.\n\n  s#\n      A number to help correlate other instances of message IXC431I that are\n      issued for the indicated member with regard to this stall.

If the stalled condition persists,\n  but other items are being successfully processed, XCF periodically\n  reissues message IXC431I with updated information. XCF may issue abend\n  X'00C' reason X'020F0006' to initiate internal XCF self verification and\n  other actions to address the situation. The abend does not directly impact\n  the stalled application in any way. If an internal XCF problem is\n  discovered, a dump will be taken. An entry in logrec is made to document\n  the situation even if no dump is taken. Message IXC432I is issued if the\n  stalled member resumes normal processing or terminates.\n\n  Operator response\n\n  This message is issued to the system log so no operator response is\n  expected. If through customer action, the message is rerouted to an\n  operator console, the operator should monitor the situation. If there does\n  not seem to be any detrimental impact, no further action may be needed.\n  Use DISPLAY XCF,GROUP,grpname, membername to get detailed information\n  about the stalled member of group grpname named membername. Message\n  IXC333I provides status information about the member and indicates what\n  work appears to be stalled.\n\n  There may be other commands provided by the indicated\n  application/subsystem that will allow you to determine its status and/or\n  alleviate the problem. If more than one member is impacted, there may be\n  an underlying system problem affecting them all. If so, investigate the\n  status of the system at large. At the direction of the system programmer,\n  you may need to obtain dumps for problem diagnosis and/or terminate the\n  indicated application.\n\n  XCF monitors its own internal use of the XCF signalling service and may\n  issue message IXC431I if XCF itself appears to be stalled. However, the\n  DISPLAY XCF,GROUP command cannot be used to investigate such stalls since\n  the command does not support the internal XCF group.\n\n  System programmer response\n\n  Check the status of the stalled application/subsystem. If multiple members\n  appear to be stalled, or if other indicators suggest work is not being\n  processed, there may be an underlying problem affecting them all. If so, a\n  broader system diagnosis my be warranted because the impacted members may\n  not be at fault. On many occasions the system will successfully resolve\n  the situation during the course of normal processing, in which case no\n  further action is warranted. If necessary, take appropriate action to\n  correct the situation or cancel/ terminate the application. Before\n  terminating the application, issue DISPLAY XCF,GROUP,grpname,ALL and any\n  relevant application display, then collect the following diagnostic\n  information: system log, application log, and an appropriate dump. In\n  addition to application specific diagnostic data, the dump should include\n  XCF data (SDATA=COUPLE).

The member appeared to be stalled\n              and this stall condition was causing sympathy sickness for one\n              or more systems in the sysplex. SFM initiated termination of\n              the member in an attempt to resolve the sympathy sickness.\n              Messages IXC430E, IXC431I, IXC615I, IXC631I, and IXC640E may\n              have been issued by the system on which the stalled member\n              resided.

Messages sent to this member\n              will either be delayed or rejected by XCF.\n\n          IMPACTFUL MISO\n              The member was message isolated but is no longer. However,\n              there appears to be a residual impact. One or more systems who\n              have been delaying or rejecting messages targeted to this\n              member have not yet recognized that the member is no longer\n              being isolated.\n\n          IMPACTED BY MISO\n              The member is being impacted by one or more members who are\n              (or were) message isolated. Messages sent by the impacted\n              member to an isolated member have been delayed or rejected by\n              XCF.\n\n  INFO for GROUP grpname MEMBER memname {ON SYSTEM sysname}\n      Identifies the group and member that is the subject of the detailed\n      information.\n\n      grpname\n          Name of the XCF group\n\n      memname\n          Name of the member\n\n      sysname\n          Name of the system that provided the detailed information.\n          The member resides on this system.\n\n  FUNCTION: mem_function\n      Identifies the description of the function, service, or application\n      associated with the member.

The active member is associated with the task\n              under which IXCJOIN was issued.\n\n          JOB STEP ASSOCIATION\n              This line appears if MEMASSOC=JOBSTEP was specified on the\n              IXCJOIN invocation that caused the member to become active.\n              The active member is associated with the job step task under\n              which IXCJOIN was issued.\n\n          ADDRESS SPACE ASSOCIATION\n              This line appears if MEMASSOC=ADDRSPACE was specified on the\n              IXCJOIN invocation that caused the member to become active.\n              The active member is associated with the address space under\n              which IXCJOIN was issued.\n\n          LASTING MEMBER\n              This line appears if LASTING=YES was specified on the IXCJOIN\n              invocation that caused the member to become active. XCF\n              preserves status information for lasting members that fail.\n\n          SYSTEM CLEANUP PARTICIPANT\n              This line appears if SYSCLEANUPMEM=YES was specified on the\n              IXCJOIN invocation that caused the member to become active.\n              XCF must wait for the member to clean up resources associated\n              with a failed system before automatic resource management\n              (ARM) can restart the batch jobs and started tasks that were\n              previously running on the failed system.\n\n          RECOVERY MANAGER\n              This line appears if RECOVERYMGR=YES was specified on the\n              IXCJOIN invocation that caused the member to become active. A\n              member that acts as a recovery manager is responsible for\n              coordinating sysplex-wide recovery processes.\n\n          CRITICAL MEMBER\n              This line appears if CRITICAL=YES was specified on the IXCJOIN\n              invocation that caused the member to become active. A critical\n              member performs functions or provides services that are\n              critical to the overall operation of the member's group. By\n              extension, such functions or services can be critical to the\n              overall operation of the system. If these functions or\n              services are impaired long enough, the member may be\n              terminated. Such termination can cause the system to be\n              removed from the sysplex.\n\n          LOCAL CLEANUP NOT NEEDED\n              This line appears if LOCALCLEANUP=CONTINUE was specified on\n              the IXCJOIN invocation that caused the member to become\n              active. This indicates that the member will not need time to\n              perform additional cleanup when the system on which it resides\n              is being removed from the sysplex. XCF will not wait for the\n              member to cleanup and will proceed to partitioning the system\n              as soon as possible.\n\n          TERMLEVEL IS termlevel\n              The first member-specific termination action to be taken by\n              XCF against the member when it is necessary to terminate the\n              member. For any member, the indicated termination action will\n              be applied if the SFM policy MEMSTALLTIME specification for\n              the system on which the member is active allows XCF to take\n              action to alleviate a sympathy sickness condition caused by\n              the member. For critical members, the indicated action can\n              also be applied if the member appears to be impaired.\n              termlevel is one of the following values:\n\n              TASK\n                  XCF will terminate the task from which the member invoked\n                  the IXCJOIN macro.\n\n              JOBSTEP\n                  XCF will terminate the job step task from which the member\n                  invoked the IXCJOIN macro\n\n              ADDRSPACE\n                  XCF will terminate the address space from which the member\n                  invoked the IXCJOIN macro.\n\n              SYSTEM\n                  The system on which the member resides will enter into\n                  wait state and be removed from the sysplex.\n\n          MEMSTALL RESOLUTION IS memstallaction\n              The first member-specific action to be taken by XCF to resolve\n              a member stall or impairment condition. For any member, the\n              indicated termination action will be applied if the SFM policy\n              MEMSTALLTIME specification for the system on which the member\n              is active allows XCF to take action to alleviate a sympathy\n              sickness condition caused by the member. For critical members,\n              the indicated action can also be applied if the member appears\n              to be impaired. memstallaction is one of the following\n              actions:\n\n                  NO ACTION\n                      XCF will not take any action to resolve the member\n                      stall or impairment condition.\n\n                  JOIN TASK TERMINATION AFTER memstalltime SECONDS\n                      XCF will terminate the task from which the stalled or\n                      impaired member invoked the IXCJOIN macro.\n\n                  JOB STEP TERMINATION AFTER memstalltime SECONDS\n                      XCF will terminate the job step task from which the\n                      stalled or impaired member invoked the IXCJOIN macro.\n\n                  ADDRESS SPACE TERMINATION AFTER memstalltime SECONDS\n                      XCF will terminate the address space from which the\n                      stalled or impaired member invoked the IXCJOIN macro.\n\n                  SYSTEM TERMINATION AFTER memstalltime SECONDS\n                      The system on which the stalled or impaired member\n                      resides will be placed into wait state and be removed\n                      from the sysplex.\n\n                  memstalltime\n                      The amount of time XCF will wait before taking the\n                      indicated termination action.\n\n          EXITS DEFINED: exits\n              The user exits defined when the member invoked IXCJOIN to join\n              its group. exits is one or more of the following:\n\n                  NONE\n                      No user exits were defined when the member joined the\n                      group.\n\n                  MESSAGE\n                      The member defined a message exit when it joined the\n                      group.\n\n                  GROUP\n                      The member defined a group exit when it joined the\n                      group.\n\n                  NOTIFY\n                      The member defined a notify exit when it joined the\n                      group.\n\n                  STATUS\n                      The member defined a status exit when it joined the\n                      group.\n\n      SIGNALLING SERVICE\n          The data that follows describes the use of the XCF Signalling\n          Service by the member.

Signal transfer is measured from the\n              time that XCF accepts the message for delivery to the time\n              that the signal(s) arrive on the target system. For messages\n              that require multiple signals, each signal contributes\n              individually to the average (they are not aggregated to\n              provide one single transfer time for the message as a whole).\n              The transfer time does not include the time spent on the\n              receiving system after the signal arrives but before the\n              message is presented to the signal exit routine of the target\n              member.\n\n              Up to 64 of the latest signals received are considered when\n              computing the average transfer time. Signals received more\n              than a minute ago are excluded from the average. For an\n              infrequent receiver, excluding old signals can make it appear\n              that its transfer time is changing even though it is not\n              receiving any new signals. N/A is displayed if no data is\n              available (no signals recently received or the sending system\n              does not provide the necessary data).

After a system\n              recognizes that a target member is message isolated, an impact\n              window is opened when the first message sent to the isolated\n              member is delayed or rejected by XCF. In general, impact\n              windows and isolation windows will coincide fairly closely in\n              time. But this need not always be the case. An impact window\n              might never open or it might open long after the isolation\n              window opens. For example, it might be the case that no member\n              tries to send a message to the target member during its\n              isolation window, or that the first attempt to send a message\n              to the target member occurs long after the isolation window\n              opens. Alternatively, the fact that a target member is message\n              isolated might not be recognized in a timely manner. Thus, the\n              sending system might continue to send messages to the isolated\n              target member long after the isolation window closes if the\n              sending system fails to recognize the closure of the isolation\n              window in a timely manner.

An exit is considered\n                      stalled if it has not made progress in a reasonable\n                      amount of time.\n\n                  crtxtkn\n                      Hexadecimal token used by XCF to identify an exit\n                      routine.\n\n                  crtextime\n                      The date and time when XCF most recently started some\n                      phase of exit processing (mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm:ss:dddddd).\n                      Usually this time will be when XCF last called the\n                      exit routine. If the exit is PENDING, this time\n                      indicates when XCF scheduled an SRB to give control to\n                      the exit routine. If the exit is PREPARING, this time\n                      indicates when XCF started doing setup work prior to\n                      calling the exit routine. If the exit is RUNNING, this\n                      time indicates when XCF called the exit routine.

For\n                            example, an SRB routine was scheduled to call\n                            the user message exit routine but has not yet\n                            been dispatched.\n\n                          o PREPARING to indicate that the work unit is\n                            running but XCF is doing setup work needed for\n                            processing the work item.\n\n                          o RUNNING to indicate that the exit routine is\n                            currently processing the work item.
