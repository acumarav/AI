The current in-use and total counts for entries\n  will always be presented when IXC585E is issued. The counts for elements\n  and EMCs will only be presented for a structure that contains those types\n  of objects. Note that the counts for all applicable structure objects that\n  the structure contains will be presented, not just those structure objects\n  which are over the threshold.\n\n  In the message text:\n\n  strname\n      The structure name of the structure that is over the threshold.\n\n  cfname\n      The coupling facility name of the facility in which the structure\n      instance is allocated.\n\n  physver1, physver2\n      The physical structure version number of the structure that is at or\n      above the threshold.\n\n  thresh\n      The structure full monitoring threshold percentage for the structure.\n\n  iuent\n      The number of in-use entries. For a list structure or a lock\n      structure, all in-use entries are considered to be changed /\n      non-reclaimable. For a cache structure, the total in-use entries may\n      contain both changed / non- reclaimable and unchanged/reclaimable\n      entries.\n\n  totent\n      The total number of entries allocated to the structure and available for\n      use by any request.\n\n      For a list structure or cache structure, this will represent all entries\n      allocated to the structure.\n\n      For a lock structure, this will represent all record data entries that\n      are not reserved. Reserved record data entries are intended to be used\n      by the lock structure exploiter during recovery scenarios when the\n      creation of record data entries must be satisfied. Connectors can\n      request reserved record data entries by specifying a value for the\n      PCTENTRYRSV keyword on the IXLCONN macro to reserve a percentage of the\n      total number of record data entries. When PCTENTRYRSV is zero, this\n      value will represent the total number of record data entries allocated\n      to the structure. For more information see the IXLCONN service.\n\n  iupct\n      The percentage of the total number of the applicable structure object\n      type (entries, elements, or EMCs) that are in use.\n\n  chgdent\n      For a cache structure, the total number of in-use entries that are\n      considered changed / non-reclaimable.\n\n  chgdpct\n      The percentage of the total number of the applicable structure object\n      type (entries or elements) that are changed.\n\n  iuresent\n      The number of in-use reserved entries.\n\n  totresent\n      The total number of reserved entries allocated to the structure.\n\n  iurespct\n      The percentage of the total number of reserved entries that are in use.\n\n  iuelem\n      The number of in-use elements. For a list structure or a lock\n      structure, all in-use elements are considered to be\n      changed/non-reclaimable. For a cache structure, the total in-use\n      elements may contain both changed/ non-reclaimable and\n      unchanged/reclaimable elements.\n\n  totelem\n      The total number of elements allocated to the structure.\n\n  chgdelem\n      For a cache structure, the total number of in-use elements that are\n      considered changed/non-reclaimable.\n\n  iuemc\n      The number of in-use EMCs.\n\n  totemc\n      The total number of EMCs allocated to the structure.\n\n  nnnnnnnn\n      The current in-use structure object count for the indicated type of\n      structure object (entries, elements or EMCs).

The size of the structure may be modified either\n  dynamically by altering the structure, or by modifying the CFRM policy\n  size definitions for the structure and then rebuilding or\n  deallocating/reallocating the structure. These actions may also be taken\n  by message-based automation.\n\n  Source\n\n  Cross System Coupling Facility (SCXCF)\n\n  Module\n\n  IXCL2MON\n\n  Routing code\n\n  2, 10M\n\n  Descriptor code\n\n  11","additional":[]}
