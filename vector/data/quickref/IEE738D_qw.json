{"heading":"IEE738D SPECIFY text FOR SLIP {xxxxxxx|COMMAND} OR\n         'CANCEL' {ID = xxxx| COMMAND}","followUp":null,"content":"  Explanation\n\n  A SLIP command was entered with an incorrect or missing parameter.\n\n  In the message text:\n\n  text\n       An indication of the incorrect or missing parameter:\n\n       ADDRESS RANGE\n           The command incorrectly specified, or did not specify, the\n           address range. An address range is required for the type of trap\n           being defined. Address ranges are defined on the following\n           parameters:\n\n           o RANGE\n\n           o LPAMOD\n\n           o LPAEP\n\n           o PVTMOD\n\n           o PVTEP\n\n           o NUCMOD\n\n           o NUCEP\n\n      RANGE KEYWORD\n          The command incorrectly specified, or did not specify, the RANGE\n          parameter. This parameter is required for the type of trap being\n          processed.\n\n      TARGETID\n          The command contained ACTION=TARGETID, but did not specify a\n          target identifier.\n\n  {xxxxxxx|COMMAND}\n      The type of SLIP command that was specified. If COMMAND appears, the\n      system could not determine the type of SLIP command.\n\n  ID=xxxx\n      The SLIP trap identifier specified on the SLIP command.\n\n  COMMAND\n      No SLIP trap identifier was specified on the SLIP command. The word\n      COMMAND is substituted.\n\n  System action\n\n  The system waits for the operator to reply.\n\n  Operator response\n\n  Do one of the following:\n\n  o Reply REPLY id,prm to specify the missing or incorrect parameter, where\n    prm is the required parameter. If the message contains TARGETID, the\n    parameter is the target identifier of the target trap.\n\n  o Reply REPLY id,CANCEL to cancel the original SLIP command. id is the\n    identifier preceding the message number.\n\n  Source\n\n  SLIP\n\n  Module\n\n  IEECB909\n\n  Routing code\n\n  *\n\n  Descriptor code\n\n  5","additional":[]}
