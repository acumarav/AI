Once full, the File's data is\noverwritten. This message is issued once the file reaches 90% capacity and\nsubsequently, each time Top Secret is restarted as long as the condition\npersists.\n\nAction:\n\nDisplay the BACKUP control option to determine if a backup of the Top Secret\nSecurity File is occurring daily. If BACKUP(INACTIVE) is seen on the TSS MODIFY\ndisplay output, a TSS MODIFY BACKUP command should be issued to request an\nimmediate backup. As long as the TSS9012W message is not occurring more often\nthan the security file is backed up, no action needs to be taken. If the\nmessage is occurring more often then the security file is backed up, the\nrecovery file should be enlarged.","additional":[]}
