{"heading":"IGW301E NORMAL PDSE SHARING FORCED, membername UNABLE TO JOIN groupname\n         RC=return-code,RSN=reason-code","followUp":null,"content":"  Explanation\n\n  The system was trying to establish EXTENDED PDSE sharing. An error\n  occurred when membername attempted to join XCF group groupname.\n\n  This is an error situation which can occur during ordinary system\n  operation or during system shutdown. While this message remains on\n  the MVS console, any shared PDSEs which are open on this system may\n  be inaccessible by other systems.\n\n  If this system hangs with this message on the console other systems\n  may have problems accessing some PDSEs. As the system completes\n  shutdown or is restarted, the message will disappear and the PDSEs\n  will be usable.\n\n  System action\n\n  This system will run with the NORMAL sharing option. Until the\n  inability to join the XCF group is resolved, this system cannot run\n  the EXTENDED option.\n\n  Operator response\n\n  Notify the system programmer.\n\n  System programmer response\n\n  A dump and the logrec data set record accompany this message. Search\n  problem reporting data bases for a fix for the problem. If no fix\n  exists, contact the IBM Support Center and provide the dump and log\n  data.\n\n  Source\n\n  Storage management subsystem (SMS)","additional":[]}
