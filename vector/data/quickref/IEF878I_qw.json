One or more devices are needed for one of the following\n  reasons:\n\n  The Request needs a unit or volume that:\n\n  1. is currently allocated to another job.\n\n  2. is currently dynamically allocated to this job\n\n  3. cannot be shared with this job\n\n  4. is offline\n\n  5. is pending offline\n\n  In the message text:\n\n  jobname\n      The name of the job.\n\n  DEVICE NAME\n      Eligible devices are currently offline or are not accessible. The\n      system issues message IEF877E or IEF878I.\n\n  'WAIT'\n      The system determined that if you wait for currently allocated,\n      eligible devices to become available, your request can be satisfied.\n\n  This message permits the operator to respond to preceding message\n  IEF157E, IEF488I, IEF877E or IEF878I.\n\n  Note:\n\n      1. While this message is outstanding (that is, has not yet been\n         replied to), no VARY OFFLINE activity can take place, due to an\n         ENQ conflict for the SYSIEFSD / Q4 resource. Any device(s)\n         targeted by a VARY OFFLINE command will not be processed.\n\n      2. While this message remains outstanding, no other allocations for\n         any device(s) within the esoteric (group name) or generic being\n         waited for in the reply to this message can proceed. That is, if\n         a job is in allocation recovery trying to allocate a 3490 device\n         (UNIT=3490), then no other D/T3490 allocations will take place\n         until after this message is satisfied. Similarly, if a job was\n         trying to allocate a device in an esoteric group named CARTNY\n         (UNIT=CARTNY), then no devices in that esoteric group would be\n         allocated until this message is satisfied.\n\n      3. While this message remains outstanding or if the reply to this\n         message is WAIT, no other allocations, unallocations, OPENs,\n         CLOSEs, Catalog LOCATEs, data set OBTAINs, or End-of-Volume (EOV\n         or FEOV) processing will be able to take place within this\n         address space until this message is replied to and the wait is\n         fulfilled. This is because the address space's SYSZTIOT resource\n         is held EXCLusive by this allocation. This statement is true\n         even if an unallocation would free up the device required by\n         this allocation.\n\n      4. While this message remains outstanding or if the reply to this\n         message is WAIT, no HCD Activates will be able to complete\n         processing.\n\n  System action\n\n  The system action depends on the operator's response as follows:\n\n  Reply of WAIT\n      Requests device allocation for this job to wait until the\n      required units or volumes, or both, are released or are brought\n      online; that is, no other allocations for any devices will be\n      able to be done within the address space which issued the\n      message until the wait is satisfied. Further, no services which\n      require the SYSZTIOT resource within that address space will be\n      able to proceed until the wait is satisfied. This includes\n      services such as OPEN, OPENJ, CLOSE, LOCATE, OBTAIN, CATALOG and\n      SCRATCH. The wait does not take effect, however, until all DD\n      statements that require devices for case two above have been\n      processed and the operator has responded to message IEF433D. The\n      system issues message IEF877E OR IEF878I for any remaining DD\n      statements and this message.\n\n  Note: A unit must be unallocated or varied online in order for\n  the wait to be satisfied. Simply unloading a unit which was made\n  unavailable to other jobs via a MOUNT command will not satisfy\n  the wait.\n\n  Reply of a device name in the list of message IEF877E or\n  IEF878I.\n      Causes the system to place the device online and retry device\n      allocation.\n\n      Note: The system may or may not actually use the specified\n      device to satisfy the allocation request. If other eligible\n      devices are found when the allocation is retried (for example,\n      an eligible device was unallocated before the IEF238D message\n      was replied to), then the system may choose from any of the\n      eligible devices. Alternatively, after the device is brought\n      online, but before the device allocation is retried, it is\n      possible for another job to allocate the device that was brought\n      online. This can result in message IEF238D being reissued.\n\n  Reply of CANCEL\n\n      For JCL Allocations:\n          Causes the system to end the job without further attempts to\n          complete allocation.\n\n      For Dynamic Allocations:\n          Causes only the allocation request to fail; it does not end the\n          entire job.\n\n  Reply of DUMP\n      Causes the system to issue an SVC DUMP to gather diagnostic\n      information that can be provided to the IBM Support Center. This\n      option should generally only be used if IEF238D was issued\n      unexpectedly, or upon request of IBM Support. After the dump is\n      issued, the system will reissue message IEF238D to allow another\n      operator response.\n\n      Note: DUMP is always a valid reply to message IEF238D. However,\n      DUMP is n ever listed in the text of message IEF238D as an\n      option.\n\n  If the reply was not valid for the options given in this message,\n   the system issues message IEF490I and repeats this message.\n\n  Operator response\n\n  Reply as follows:\n\n  o REPLY id,'dev', where dev is a device number in message IEF877E or\n    IEF878I and the device can be brought online. If device dev was\n    listed as NOT ACCESSIBLE, enter a VARY CPU/CH/PATH command before\n    this reply. Enter a DISPLAY MATRIX command to get the status of the\n    central processor and channel.\n\n  o REPLY id,'WAIT' to cause device allocation to wait for devices\n    and/or volumes to be freed.\n\n  o REPLY id,'CANCEL' to end the job.\n\n  Note:\n\n      1. For JCL Allocations: Although an operator CANCEL command may\n         be issued while this message is outstanding, the command\n         will not take effect until the system processes all the DD\n         statements for the current job step that still requires a\n         device.\n\n      2. For Dynamic Allocations: If an operator CANCEL command is\n         issued while this message is outstanding, the command will\n         take effect immediately, causing the entire job to be\n         cancelled.\n\n  o REPLY id,'DUMP' to request that the system issue an SVC DUMP. After\n    the dump is issued, message IEF238D will be reissued.\n\n  Enter one of the replies to this message before processing continues\n  for this job and any VARY OFFLINE commands can take effect.\n\n  System programmer response\n\n  If a manual operator response to this message is not desired, refer\n  to z/OS MVS Initialization and Tuning Reference for information on\n  how to use the ALLOCxx parmlib member to set a policy that will\n  allow the system to automatically reply \"CANCEL' or 'WAIT'.\n\n  Source\n\n  Allocation\n\n  Module\n\n  IEFAB488\n\n  Routing code\n\n  2,3/4/7\n\n  Descriptor code\n\n  7\n ","additional":[]},{"heading":"IEF157E jobname .procstep. stepname ddname .+ xxx .

The system is waiting for the operator to respond, based\n  on the following:\n\n  o For a batch job, the system can either:\n\n      - Release the devices that have already been allocated to the\n        job and cannot be shared with other jobs.\n\n      - Leave the devices allocated until the job can be completely\n        allocated.\n\n  o If the allocation is dynamic, the system can either:\n\n      - Release only the devices requested by that particular SVC 99\n\n      - Leave the devices allocated until the job's outstanding\n        requests can be completely allocated.\n\n  o If no online devices are available, then pending offline devices\n    may be allocated to satisfy the request.\n\n    In the message text:\n\n  jobname\n      The name of the job.\n\n  System action\n\n  The system action depends on whether the operator responds with\n  HOLD or NOHOLD. In either case, allocations to direct access\n  devices are not released. If these allocations are for NEW data\n  sets, the space those data sets are to occupy is already\n  allocated but not used until all the devices needed by this job\n  are available (that is, until the WAIT situation has been\n  relieved).\n\n  o If the reply is HOLD, the system will not release any of the\n    devices that have already been allocated to this job before it\n    waits for the required units or volumes.\n\n    Be aware that using the HOLD reply might cause a deadlock\n    situation, particularly when the device is being used by a job\n    that is going to wait. The system does not release any\n    non-sharable devices (that is, non-DASD) that have already been\n    allocated to the job before it waits for required units and\n    volumes. To avoid this problem, only one job in the system\n    should use the HOLD option at a time.\n\n    Also Note that replying HOLD prevents any subsequent vary\n    offline requests from completing successfully, until either the\n    HOLD is satisfied (required devices become available) or the job\n    is cancelled. Vary offline requests issued while HOLD is in\n    effect and the device to be varied offline is placed in a\n    pending offline condition. When the HOLD condition is relieved,\n    the system completes vary offline processing normally.\n\n    When devices for a job are held during a wait, and a device that\n    was eligible for allocation to the job becomes ineligible for\n    allocation (because of its use by a system utility, for example),\n     the job might fail because it does not have enough devices to\n    complete successfully. Message IEF700I in the job log identifies\n    this failure. Refer to message IEF700I for information on how to\n    respond to this failure.\n\n  o If the reply is NOHOLD, the system will release those devices\n    that have been allocated to this job, but that cannot be shared\n    with other jobs.\n\n  o Regardless of whether the reply to this message is HOLD or\n    NOHOLD, or if the message is left outstanding (not replied to),\n    no other allocations, unallocations, OPENs, CLOSEs, Catalog\n    LOCATEs, data set OBTAINs, or End-\n\n    of-Volume (EOV or FEOV) processing will be able to take place\n    within this address space until this message is replied to and\n    the WAIT is fulfilled. This is because the address space's\n    SYSZTIOT resource is held EXCLusive by this allocation. This\n    statement is true even if an unallocation would free up the\n    device required by this allocation.\n\n  For an example of the HOLD versus NOHOLD options, assume that\n  JOBA owns an automatically switchable device and is waiting for\n  a printer. Assume also that JOBB owns the printer JOBA needs and\n  is waiting for the automatically switchable device JOBA owns.\n\n  o If the reply is HOLD for each job, the two jobs will wait until\n    one job is cancelled. This deadlock can be even more complex\n    depending on the number of jobs waiting.\n\n  o If the reply is NOHOLD for each job, allocation responds on a\n    first-come, first-served basis. After the first job finishes\n    using a resource, it is available to the second.\n\n  o If the reply is NOHOLD for JOBA and HOLD for JOBB, the system\n    will release the automatically switchable device that had been\n    allocated to JOBA. This device is now available for JOBB. JOBA\n    will wait until JOBB unallocates the printer.\n\n  o If the reply is NOHOLD for JOBB and HOLD for JOBA, the system\n    will release the printer that had been allocated to JOBB. This\n    device is now available for JOBA. JOBB will wait until JOBA\n    unallocates the automatically switchable device.\n\n  Operator response\n\n  Do one of the following:\n\n  o Reply xx,'HOLD' to have the system wait while holding the\n    devices already allocated.\n\n  o Reply xx,'NOHOLD' to have the system release the devices that\n    are not shareable before it waits.\n\n  System programmer response\n\n  If a manual response to this message is not desired, refer to\n  z/OS MVS Initialization and Tuning Reference for information on\n  how to use the ALLOCxx parmlib member to set a policy that will\n  allow the system to automatically reply 'HOLD' or 'NOHOLD'.\n\n  Source\n\n  Allocation\n\n  Module\n\n  IEFAB487\n\n  Routing code\n\n  2, 3/4/7\n\n  Descriptor code\n\n  2\n ","additional":[]},{"heading":"IEF007I RESTART NOT SUCCESSFUL FOR jobname (reason-code)","copyright":"Text Below Copyright (c) 2023, IBM","followUp":"V=IBM P=Z/OS SYSTEM MSGS R=V2R5 I=IEF007I","content":"  Explanation\n\n  An error occurred during checkpoint restart for a job.\n\n  In the message text:\n\n  jobname\n      The name of the checkpointed job.\n\n  reason-code\n      A decimal reason code that indicates why the restart was not\n      successful, as follows:\n\n  031\n      A DD statement was DUMMY in the original running of the job, but is\n      not DUMMY in the restart.\n\n  034\n      A DD statement is missing for the restarted step.\n\n  038\n      An uncorrectable input/output error occurred when the system read the\n      checkpoint data set.\n\n  230\n      The checkpoint data set was not secure.\n\n  231\n      An error occurred during dynamic allocation of the checkpoint data set.\n\n  232\n      The system could not open the checkpoint data set successfully.\n\n  233\n      In a partitioned checkpoint data set, the system could not find the\n      specified entry.\n\n  235\n      The system encountered a checkpoint entry record of an undetermined\n      type, or did not find an END record when expected.\n\n  237\n      The system could not find a specified checkpoint entry.\n\n  238\n      An error occurred during dynamic allocation or dynamic deallocation\n      for a private or implied catalog needed to process the data set\n      descriptor record (DSDR).\n\n  239\n      During a deferred restart, the system found a non-DUMMY DD entry for a\n      virtual input output (VIO) data set, or allocated a dynamically\n      allocated VIO data set after taking the checkpoint.\n\n  260\n      The scheduler work area (SWA) for the checkpointed job resides above\n      16 megabytes.
