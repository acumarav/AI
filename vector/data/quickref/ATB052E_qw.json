However, the system could not open the Virtual\n      Telecommunications Access Method (VTAM) access method control block\n      (ACB) for the specified LU. This LU is in pending state. Some of the\n       return codes returned from OPEN can be a temporary condition which\n      gets resolved. For example, this message may be encountered when\n      APPC/MVS is activated, but VTAM is not active or completely\n      initialized. To determine if the problem has been resolved, check the\n      status of the LU by issuing the DISPLAY APPC,LU,ALL command. If the LU\n      is now active then the condition has been resolved and no further\n      actions are required.\n\n      In the message text:\n\n      luname\n          The pending LU.\n\n      schedname\n          The transaction scheduler that will use this LU.\n\n      error-field-value\n          The value of the VTAM OPEN macro ERROR field (in hexadecimal).\n\n      System action\n\n      The system continues processing.\n\n      Operator response\n\n      Ask the system programmer to correct the problem. If the pending LU is\n      not needed, enter the SET APPC command to delete it.\n\n      System programmer response\n\n      error-field-value is the value of the ERROR field returned by the VTAM\n      OPEN macro. For more information, see ERROR field meanings for the\n      OPEN macro in z/OS Communications Server: SNA Programming. When you\n      correct the problem, the system will activate the LU.\n\n      Module\n\n      ATBLUPR\n\n      Source\n\n      APPC/MVS\n\n      Routing Code\n\n      2\n\n      Descriptor Code\n\n      11","additional":[]}
